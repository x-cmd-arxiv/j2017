The density and velocity structure of the gas in\nthe outskirts provide an effective pressure support and affect all processes\nlisted above. Therefore it is important to resolve and properly model the\nturbulent flow in these mildly overdense and relatively large cluster regions;\nthis is a challenging task for hydrodynamical codes. In this work, grid-based\nsimulations of a galaxy cluster are presented. The simulations are performed\nusing adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) based on the regional variability of\nvorticity, and they include a subgrid scale model (SGS) for unresolved\nturbulence. The implemented AMR strategy is more effective in resolving the\nturbulent flow in the cluster outskirts than any previously used criterion\nbased on overdensity. We study a cluster undergoing a major merger, which\ndrives turbulence in the medium. The merger dominates the cluster energy budget\nout to a few virial radii from the centre. In these regions the shocked\nintra-cluster medium is resolved and the SGS turbulence is modelled, and\ncompared with diagnostics on larger length scale. The volume-filling factor of\nthe flow with large vorticity is about 60% at low redshift in the cluster\noutskirts, and thus smaller than in the cluster core. In the framework of\nmodelling radio relics, this point suggests that upstream flow inhomogeneities\nmight affect pre-existing cosmic-ray population and magnetic fields, and the\nresulting radio emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2017 16:00:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-29"}

But most tasks considered so far have confined themselves to\nthe processing of objects and lexicalised relations amongst objects (content\nwords). We know, however, that humans (even pre-school children) can abstract\nover raw data to perform certain types of higher-level reasoning, expressed in\nnatural language by function words. A case in point is given by their ability\nto learn quantifiers, i.e. expressions like 'few', 'some' and 'all'. From\nformal semantics and cognitive linguistics, we know that quantifiers are\nrelations over sets which, as a simplification, we can see as proportions. For\ninstance, in 'most fish are red', most encodes the proportion of fish which are\nred fish. In this paper, we study how well current language and vision\nstrategies model such relations. We show that state-of-the-art attention\nmechanisms coupled with a traditional linguistic formalisation of quantifiers\ngives best performance on the task. Additionally, we provide insights on the\nrole of 'gist' representations in quantification. A 'logical' strategy to\ntackle the task would be to first obtain a numerosity estimation for the two\ninvolved sets and then compare their cardinalities. We however argue that\nprecisely identifying the composition of the sets is not only beyond current\nstate-of-the-art models but perhaps even detrimental to a task that is most\nefficiently performed by refining the approximate numerosity estimator of the\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2017 16:03:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-11"}

In the real NMSSM (rNMSSM), when the mass difference between two scalar\nstates is comparable to their individual total decay widths, the quantum\nmechanical interference, due to the relevant diagonal as well as off-diagonal\nterms in the propagator matrix, between them can become sizable. This\npossibility invalidates usage of the narrow width approximation (NWA) to\ncompute the cross section for the production of a di-photon pair with a given\ninvariant mass via resonant Higgs boson(s) in the gluon fusion process at the\nLarge Hadron Collider (LHC). When, motivated by the baryon asymmetry of the\nuniverse, CP-violating (CPV) phases are explicitly invoked in the Higgs sector\nof the NMSSM, all the interaction eigenstates mix to give five CP-indefinite\nphysical Higgs bosons. In this scenario, the interference effects due the\noff-diagonal terms in the Higgs mass matrix that mix the pseudoscalar-like\nstate with the SM-like one can also become significant, when these two are\nsufficiently mass-degenerate.

We formulate a complete impedance tensor decomposition into the PT and a\nnew Amplitude Tensor (AT) that is shown to be complementary and mathematically\nindependent to the PT. We show that for the special cases of 1D and 2D models,\nthe geometric AT parameters (strike and skew angles) converge to PT parameters\nand the singular values of the AT correspond to the impedance amplitudes of the\ntransverse electric and transverse magnetic modes. In all cases, we show that\nthe AT contains both galvanic and inductive amplitudes, the latter of which is\nargued to be physically related to the inductive information of the PT. The\ngeometric parameters of the inductive AT and the PT represent the same geometry\nof the subsurface conductivity distribution that is affected by induction\nprocesses, and therefore we hypothesise that geometric PT parameters can be\nused to approximate the inductive AT. Then, this hypothesis leads to the\nestimation of the galvanic AT which is equal to the galvanic electric\ndistortion tensor at the lowest measured period. This estimation of the\ngalvanic distortion departs from the common assumption to consider 1D or 2D\nregional structures and can be applied for general 3D subsurfaces.

We\ncompare various methods for creating similarity scores between noisy records,\nconsidering different combinations of string matching, term frequency-inverse\ndocument frequency methods, and n-gram techniques. In particular, we introduce\na vectorized soft term frequency-inverse document frequency method, with an\noptional refinement step. We also discuss two methods to deal with missing data\nin computing similarity scores.\n  We test our method on the Los Angeles Police Department Field Interview Card\ndata set, the Cora Citation Matching data set, and two sets of restaurant\nreview data. The results show that the methods that use words as the basic\nunits are preferable to those that use 3-grams. Moreover, in some (but\ncertainly not all) parameter ranges soft term frequency-inverse document\nfrequency methods can outperform the standard term frequency-inverse document\nfrequency method. The results also confirm that our method for automatically\ndetermining the number of groups typically works well in many cases and allows\nfor accurate results in the absence of a priori knowledge of the number of\nunique entities in the data set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2017 17:05:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Apr 2018 10:20:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-11"}

This implies that they can be used as tracers of the\nchemical enrichment of matter in the Universe at high redshift. Comparable\nobservations in stars are more difficult and, until recently, plagued by small\nnumber statistics. We wish to exploit the Gaia ESO Survey (GES) data to study\nthe behaviour of sulfur and zinc abundances of a large number of Galactic\nstars, in a homogeneous way. By using the UVES spectra of the GES sample, we\nare able to assemble a sample of 1301 Galactic stars, including stars in open\nand globular clusters in which both sulfur and zinc were measured. We confirm\nthe results from the literature that sulfur behaves as an alpha-element. We\nfind a large scatter in [Zn/Fe] ratios among giant stars around solar\nmetallicity. The lower ratios are observed in giant stars at Galactocentric\ndistances less than 7.5 kpc. No such effect is observed among dwarf stars,\nsince they do not extend to that radius. Given the sample selection, giants and\ndwarfs are observed at different Galactic locations, and it is plausible, and\ncompatible with simple calculations, that Zn-poor giants trace a younger\npopulation more polluted by SN Ia yields. It is necessary to extend\nobservations in order to observe both giants and dwarfs at the same Galactic\nlocation. Further theoretical work on the evolution of zinc is also necessary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2017 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-30"}

Previous\nworks mainly studied to which extent the $g$-modes are excited in the PNS. In\nthis paper, on the other hand, we investigate how strong the acoustic wave\nneeds to be if it were to revive a stalled shock wave.

We perform both 1D\nand 2D parametrized simulations, in which we inject acoustic waves from the\ninner boundary. In order to quantify the power of acoustic waves, we use the\nextended Myers theory to take neutrino reactions into proper account. We find\nfor the 1D simulations that rather large acoustic powers are required to\nrelaunch the shock wave, since the additional heating provided by the secondary\nshocks developed from acoustic waves is partially canceled by the neutrino\ncooling that is also enhanced. In 2D, the required acoustic powers are\nconsistent with those of Burrows et al.

In suitable descriptions of\nsuch systems, it can be helpful to resort to effective models which focus on\nthe essential degrees of freedom of the given model. In this work, we analyze\nhow to determine the validity of an effective model by demanding it to be in\nthe same phase as the original model. We focus our study on one-dimensional\nspin-1/2 systems and explain how non-trivial symmetry protected topologically\nordered (SPT) phases of an effective spin 1 model can arise depending on the\ncouplings in the original Hamiltonian. In this analysis, tensor network methods\nfeature in two ways: On the one hand, we make use of recent techniques for the\nclassification of SPT phases using matrix product states in order to identify\nthe phases in the effective model with those in the underlying physical system,\nemploying Kuenneth's theorem for cohomology. As an intuitive paradigmatic model\nwe exemplify the developed methodology by investigating the bi-layered\ndelta-chain.

Our approach brings together some of the strengths of\nintrinsic motivation and hierarchical methods: the learning of useful skill is\nguided by a single proxy reward, the design of which requires very minimal\ndomain knowledge about the downstream tasks. Then a high-level policy is\ntrained on top of these skills, providing a significant improvement of the\nexploration and allowing to tackle sparse rewards in the downstream tasks. To\nefficiently pre-train a large span of skills, we use Stochastic Neural Networks\ncombined with an information-theoretic regularizer.

The vision is that such methods will,\neventually, be used to simulate theories in $(3+1)$ dimensions in regimes\ndifficult for other methods. So far, however, TN methods have mostly simulated\nlattice gauge theories in $(1+1)$ dimensions. The aim of this paper is to\nexplore the simulation of quantum electrodynamics (QED) on infinite lattices\nwith TNs, i.e., fermionic matter fields coupled to a $U(1)$ gauge field,\ndirectly in the thermodynamic limit. With this idea in mind we first consider a\ngauge-invariant iDMRG simulation of the Schwinger model -i.e., QED in\n$(1+1)d$-. After giving a precise description of the numerical method, we\nbenchmark our simulations by computing the substracted chiral condensate in the\ncontinuum, in good agreement with other approaches. Our simulations of the\nSchwinger model allow us to build intuition about how a simulation should\nproceed in $(2+1)$ dimensions. Based on this, we propose a variational ansatz\nusing infinite Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS) to describe the ground\nstate of $(2+1)d$ QED. The ansatz includes $U(1)$ gauge symmetry at the level\nof the tensors, as well as fermionic (matter) and bosonic (gauge) degrees of\nfreedom both at the physical and virtual levels.

In addition to translational zero modes they have also\norientational moduli associated with rotations of their fluxes inside a\nnon-Abelian group. The dynamics of the orientational moduli is described by the\ntwo dimensional CP(N-1) model living on the world sheet of the non-Abelian\nstring. In this paper we consider a deformation of N=2 supersymmetric QCD with\nthe U(N) gauge group and N_f=N quark flavors with a mass term $\\mu$ of the\nadjoint matter. In the limit of large $\\mu$ the theory flows to an N=1\nsupersymmetric QCD. We study the solution for the non-Abelian string in this\nlimit and derive an effective theory on the string world sheet. The bosonic\nsector of this theory is still given by the CP(N-1) model but its scale is\nexponentially small as compared to the scale of the four dimensional bulk\ntheory in contrast to the N=2 case where these scales are equal. We study also\nthe fermionic sector of the world sheet theory. Upon the deformation the\nnon-Abelian string is no longer BPS and we show that the fermionic\nsuperorientational zero modes are all lifted. This leaves us with the pure\nbosonic CP(N-1) model on the string world sheet in the limit of N=1 QCD. We\nalso discuss what happens to confined monopoles at large $\\mu$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2017 20:27:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-21"}

Many\nproposed approaches face challenging problems in dealing with the alignments of\ndifferent face regions, in the effective fusion of temporal information, and in\ntraining a model for multiple AU labels. To better address these problems, we\npropose a deep learning framework for AU detection with region of interest\n(ROI) adaptation, integrated multi-label learning, and optimal LSTM-based\ntemporal fusing. First, ROI cropping nets (ROI Nets) are designed to make sure\nspecifically interested regions of faces are learned independently; each\nsub-region has a local convolutional neural network (CNN) - an ROI Net, whose\nconvolutional filters will only be trained for the corresponding region.\nSecond, multi-label learning is employed to integrate the outputs of those\nindividual ROI cropping nets, which learns the inter-relationships of various\nAUs and acquires global features across sub-regions for AU detection. Finally,\nthe optimal selection of multiple LSTM layers to form the best LSTM Net is\ncarried out to best fuse temporal features, in order to make the AU prediction\nthe most accurate.

Most of these tools allow users\nto express hybrid system as automata with a set of ordinary differential\nequations (ODEs) associated with each state, as well as rules for transitions\nbetween states. Significant effort goes into developing and verifying and\ncorrectly implementing those tools. As such, it is desirable to expand the\nscope of applicability tools of such as far as possible. With this goal, we\nshow how compile-time transformations can be used to extend the basic hybrid\nODE formalism traditionally supported in hybrid reachability tools such as\nSpaceEx or Flow*. The extension supports certain types of partial derivatives\nand equational constraints. These extensions allow users to express, among\nother things, the Euler-Lagrangian equation, and to capture practically\nrelevant constraints that arise naturally in mechanical systems. Achieving this\nlevel of expressiveness requires using a binding time-analysis (BTA), program\ndifferentiation, symbolic Gaussian elimination, and abstract interpretation\nusing interval analysis. Except for BTA, the other components are either\nreadily available or can be easily added to most reachability tools. The paper\ntherefore focuses on presenting both the declarative and algorithmic\nspecifications for the BTA phase, and establishes the soundness of the\nalgorithmic specifications with respect to the declarative one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2017 00:57:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-12"}

To determine whether this is due to a\nreal, physical modulation or is simply a large statistical fluctuation requires\nthe measurement of new modes. Here we forecast how well CMB polarization data\nfrom \\Planck\\ and future experiments will be able to confirm or constrain\nphysical models for modulation. Fitting several such models to the \\Planck\\\ntemperature data allows us to provide predictions for polarization asymmetry.\nWhile for some models and parameters \\Planck\\ polarization will decrease error\nbars on the modulation amplitude by only a small percentage, we show,\nimportantly, that cosmic-variance-limited (and in some cases even \\Planck)\npolarization data can decrease the errors by considerably better than the\nexpectation of $\\sqrt 2$ based on simple $\\ell$-space arguments.

The implicit UGKS significantly increases the\nconvergence speed for steady flow computations, especially in the highly\nrarefied and near continuum regime. In order to further improve the\ncomputational efficiency, for the first time a geometric multigrid technique is\nintroduced into the implicit UGKS, where the prediction step for the\nequilibrium state and the evolution step for the distribution function are both\ntreated with multigrid acceleration. The multigrid implicit UGKS (MIUGKS) is\nused in the non-equilibrium flow study, which includes microflow, such as\nlid-driven cavity flow and the flow passing through a finite-length flat plate,\nand high speed one, such as supersonic flow over a square cylinder.

To cope with the performance\nimprovement of SSDs, storage systems have rapidly adopted the host interface\nfor SSDs from Serial-ATA, which is used for existing hard disk drives, to\nhigh-speed PCI express. Since NAND flash memory does not allow in-place\nupdates, it requires special software called Flash Translation Layer (FTL), and\nSSDs are equipped with embedded processors to run FTL. Existing SSDs increase\nthe clock frequency of embedded processors or increase the number of embedded\nprocessors in order to prevent FTL from acting as bottleneck of SSD\nperformance, but these approaches are not scalable.

However, training large-scale SFNN is notoriously\nharder. In this paper, we aim at developing efficient training methods for\nSFNN, in particular using known architectures and pre-trained parameters of\nDNN. To this end, we propose a new intermediate stochastic model, called\nSimplified-SFNN, which can be built upon any baseline DNNand approximates\ncertain SFNN by simplifying its upper latent units above stochastic ones. The\nmain novelty of our approach is in establishing the connection between three\nmodels, i.e., DNN->Simplified-SFNN->SFNN, which naturally leads to an efficient\ntraining procedure of the stochastic models utilizing pre-trained parameters of\nDNN. Using several popular DNNs, we show how they can be effectively\ntransferred to the corresponding stochastic models for both multi-modal and\nclassification tasks on MNIST, TFD, CASIA, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and SVHN\ndatasets.

We would like to show a mesh-dependent convergence\nwith a minimal number of basis functions. Our construction starts with an\nauxiliary multiscale space by solving local spectral problems. In auxiliary\nmultiscale space, we select the basis functions that correspond to small\n(contrast-dependent) eigenvalues. These basis functions represent the channels\n(high-contrast features that connect the boundaries of the coarse block). Using\nthe auxiliary space, we propose a constraint energy minimization to construct\nmultiscale spaces. The minimization is performed in the oversampling domain,\nwhich is larger than the target coarse block. The constraints allow handling\nnon-decaying components of the local minimizers. If the auxiliary space is\ncorrectly chosen, we show that the convergence rate is independent of the\ncontrast (because the basis representing the channels are included in the\nauxiliary space) and is proportional to the coarse-mesh size (because the\nconstrains handle non-decaying components of the local minimizers).

The\nconvergence theorem requires that channels are not aligned with the coarse\nedges, which hold in many applications, where the channels are oblique with\nrespect to the coarse-mesh geometry.

We present a novel method to reconstruct the solid-void structure of\nporous media by applying a generative neural network that allows an implicit\ndescription of the probability distribution represented by three-dimensional\nimage datasets.

The fully convolutional nature of the trained\nneural network allows the generation of large samples while maintaining\ncomputational efficiency.

The difficulty associated with\nthe direct growth on flexible substrates can overcome by adopting an effective\nstrategy of transferring the well grown VGNs onto arbitrary flexible substrates\nthrough soft chemistry route.

High-resolution observations\nof the Sun at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths are challenging due to\nthe intense, extended, low- contrast, and dynamic nature of emission from the\nquiet Sun, and the extremely intense and variable nature of emissions\nassociated with energetic phenomena. The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter\nArray (ALMA) was designed with solar observations in mind. The requirements for\nsolar observations are significantly different from observations of sidereal\nsources and special measures are necessary to successfully carry out this type\nof observations. We describe the commissioning efforts that enable the use of\ntwo frequency bands, the 3 mm band (Band 3) and the 1.25 mm band (Band 6), for\ncontinuum interferometric-imaging observations of the Sun with ALMA. Examples\nof high-resolution synthesized images obtained using the newly commissioned\nmodes during the solar commissioning campaign held in December 2015 are\npresented. Although only 30 of the eventual 66 ALMA antennas were used for the\ncampaign, the solar images synthesized from the ALMA commissioning data reveal\nnew features of the solar atmosphere that demonstrate the potential power of\nALMA solar observations. The ongoing expansion of ALMA and solar-commissioning\nefforts will continue to enable new and unique solar observing capabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2017 10:53:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2017 00:59:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-21"}

Despite the huge effort made to\nstudy this property, there is no general analytical criterion to automatically\ncheck the state observability when the dynamics are also driven by unknown\ninputs. Here, we introduce the general analytical solution of this fundamental\nproblem, often called the unknown input observability problem. We provide the\nsystematic procedure, based on automatic computation (differentiation and\nmatrix rank determination), that allows us to automatically check the state\nobservability even in the presence of unknown inputs. The fundamental step to\nobtain this solution is the introduction of the group of invariance of\nobservability. We introduce the group of transformations under which\nobservability is invariant. Based on this group, we introduce new tensor fields\nwith respect to this group of transformations. The analytical solution of the\nunknown input observability problem is expressed in terms of these tensors.\nThis paper provides this solution together with the main analytical steps for\nits derivation and a sketch of the proof of its validity.

From an online social network like\nWeChat, we could collect a large number of information cascade trees, each of\nwhich tells the spreading trajectory of a message/information such as which\nuser creates the information and which users view or forward the information\nshared by which neighbors. In this work, we propose two heterogeneous\nnon-linear models. Both models are validated by the WeChat data in reproducing\nand explaining key features of cascade trees. Specifically, we firstly apply\nthe Random Recursive Tree (RRT) to model the cascade tree topologies, capturing\nkey features, i.e. the average path length and degree variance of a cascade\ntree in relation to the number of nodes (size) of the tree. The RRT model with\na single parameter $\\theta$ describes the growth mechanism of a tree, where a\nnode in the existing tree has a probability $d_i^{\\theta}$ of being connected\nto a newly added node that depends on the degree $d_i$ of the existing node.\nThe identified parameter $\\theta$ quantifies the relative depth or broadness of\nthe cascade trees, indicating that information propagates via a star-like\nbroadcasting or viral-like hop by hop spreading. The RRT model explains the\nappearance of hubs, thus a possibly smaller average path length as the cascade\nsize increases, as observed in WeChat. We further propose the stochastic\nSusceptible View Forward Removed (SVFR) model to depict the dynamic user\nbehaviors including creating, viewing, forwarding and ignoring a message on a\ngiven social network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2017 12:18:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-17"}

In this system, we\npresent a novel multiuser MIMO detection framework that is inspired by coding\ntheory. The key idea of the proposed framework is to create a code C of length\n2Nr over a spatial domain. This code is constructed by a so-called\nauto-encoding function that is not designable but is completely described by a\nchannel transformation followed by a quantization function of the ADCs.

To the resulting problem, we propose a novel weighted minimum\ndistance decoding (wMDD) that appropriately exploits the unequal channel\nreliabilities. It is shown that the proposed wMDD yields a non-trivial gain\nover the conventional minimum distance decoding (MDD). From coding-theoretic\nviewpoint, we identify that bit-error-rate (BER) exponentially decreases with\nthe minimum distance of the code C, which plays a similar role with a condition\nnumber in conventional MIMO systems.

When varying the pulse\nareas of the exciting laser pulses the so-called Rabi rotations can be resolved\nby the two-pulse FWM technique. We investigate these Rabi rotations within two-\nand three-level systems, both theoretically and experimentally, and explain\ntheir damping by the coupling to acoustic phonons. To highlight the importance\nof the pulse area influence, we show that the phonon-induced dephasing of QD\nexcitons depends on the pulse intensity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2017 14:01:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-27"}

The bulge MDF is confirmed to be bimodal across the whole sampled\narea, with metal-poor stars dominating at high latitudes. The metal-rich stars\nexhibit bar-like kinematics and display a bimodality in their magnitude\ndistribution, a feature which is tightly associated with the X-shape bulge.\nThey overlap with the metal-rich end of the thin disk sequence in the [Mg/Fe]\nvs. [Fe/H] plane. Metal-poor bulge stars have a more isotropic hot kinematics\nand do not participate in the X-shape bulge. With similar Mg-enhancement\nlevels, the position of the metal-poor bulge sequence \"knee\" is observed at\n[Fe/H]$_{knee}=-0.37\\pm0.09$, being 0.06 dex higher than that of the thick\ndisk. It suggests a higher SFR for the bulge than for the thick disk. Finally,\nwe present a chemical evolution model that suitably fits the whole bulge\nsequence by assuming a fast ($<1$ Gyr) intense burst of stellar formation at\nearly epochs. We associate metal-rich stars with the B/P bulge formed from the\nsecular evolution of the early thin disk.

Since the solar\nbirth cluster is likely to have been massive (1000--10 000 Msol), and therefore\nlong-lived, an issue concerns the survival of such a primordial Oort Cloud. We\nhave investigated this issue by simulating the orbital evolution of Oort Cloud\ncomets for several hundred Myr, assuming the Sun to start its life as a typical\nmember of such a massive cluster. We have devised a synthetic representation of\nthe relevant dynamics, where the cluster potential is represented by a King\nmodel, and about 20 close encounters with individual cluster stars are selected\nand integrated based on the solar orbit and the cluster structure. Thousands of\nindividual simulations are made, each including 3 000 comets with orbits with\nthree different initial semi-major axes. Practically the entire initial Oort\nCloud is found to be lost for our choice of semi-major axes (5 000--20 000 au),\nindependent of the cluster mass, although the chance of survival is better for\nthe smaller cluster, since in a certain fraction of the simulations the Sun\norbits at relatively safe distances from the dense cluster centre. For the\nrange of birth cluster sizes that we investigate, a primordial Oort Cloud will\nlikely survive only as a small inner core with semi-major axes < 3 000 au. Such\na population of comets would be inert to orbital diffusion into an outer halo\nand subsequent injection into observable orbits. Some mechanism is therefore\nneeded to accomplish this transfer, in case the Oort Cloud is primordial and\nthe birth cluster did not have a low mass. From this point of view, our results\nlend some support to a delayed formation of the Oort Cloud, that occurred after\nthe Sun had left its birth cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2017 15:04:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-19"}

Human amylin oligomerizes easily and can deposit in the pancreas,\nbrain, and heart, where they have been associated with calcium dysregulation.\nIn the heart, accumulating evidence suggests that human amylin oligomers form\nmodestly cation-selective, voltage-dependent ion channels that embed in the\ncell sarcolemma (SL). The oligomers increase membrane conductance in a\ndose-dependent manner, which is correlated with elevated cytosolic calcium\n(Ca2+). Our core hypothesis therefore is that non-selective inward Ca2+\nconduction afforded by human amylin oligomers increase cytosolic and\nsarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ load, which thereby magnifies intracellular\nCa2+ transients. Questions remain however regarding the mechanism of\namylin-induced Ca2+ dysregulation, including whether enhanced SL Ca2+ influx is\nsufficient to elevate cytosolic Ca2+ load, and if so, how might amplified Ca2+\ntransients perturb Ca2+-dependent cardiac pathways. To investigate these\nquestions, we modified a computational model of cardiomyocytes Ca2+ signaling\nto reflect experimentally-measured changes in SL membrane permeation and\ndecreased Sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) function\nstemming from acute and transgenic human amylin peptide exposure. With this\nmodel, we confirmed the hypothesis that increasing SL permeation alone was\nsufficient to enhance Ca2+ transient amplitudes. Our model indicated that\namplified cytosolic transients are driven by increased Ca2+ loading of the\nsarcoplasmic reticulum and may contribute to the Ca2+-dependent activation of\ncalmodulin. These findings suggest that increased membrane permeation induced\nby deposition of amylin oligomers contributes to Ca2+ dysregulation in\npre-diabetes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2017 15:22:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-16"}

The first steps of this were done in pure quantum mechanical terms,\nhinting at the traversable character of the would-be classical singularity, and\nthen others were performed using effective heuristic models capturing quantum\neffects that allowed a geometrical description closer to the classical one but\navoided its singularity. However, the problem of establishing the link between\nthe quantum and effective descriptions was left open. In this work, we propose\nto fill in this gap by considering the path-integral approach to the loop\nquantization of the Kantowski-Sachs model corresponding to the Schwarzschild\nblack hole interior. We show that the transition amplitude can be expressed as\na path integration over the imaginary exponential of an effective action which\njust coincides, under some simplifying assumptions, with the heuristic one.\nAdditionally, we further explore the consequences of the effective dynamics. We\nprove first that such dynamics imply some rather simple bounds for phase-space\nvariables, and in turn, remarkably, in an analytical way, they imply that\nvarious phase-space functions that were singular in the classical model are now\nwell behaved.

Among them, 31 objects have also been\ndetected in the on-going all-sky survey by the BAT telescope of the Swift\nobservatory. For 26 sources on the list, we suggest possible identifications:\n21 active galactic nuclei, two cataclysmic variables, two isolated pulsars or\npulsar wind nebulae, and one supernova remnant; 46 sources from the catalogue\nremain unclassified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2017 15:34:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-26"}

These include the\nrecently discovered quantum Griffith singularity in atomic Ga films,\ntopological phases in proximized topological insulators and unconventional\nIsing pairing in transition metal dichalcogenide layers. In LaAlO3/SrTiO3\nheterostructures, a gate tunable superconducting electron gas is confined in a\nquantum well at the interface between two insulating oxides. Remarkably, the\ngas coexists with both magnetism and strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling and is a\ncandidate system for the creation of Majorana fermions. However, both the\norigin of superconductivity and the nature of the transition to the normal\nstate over the whole doping range remain elusive. Missing such crucial\ninformation impedes harnessing this outstanding system for future\nsuperconducting electronics and topological quantum computing. Here we show\nthat the superconducting phase diagram of LaAlO3/SrTiO3 is controlled by the\ncompetition between electron pairing and phase coherence. Through resonant\nmicrowave experiments, we measure the superfluid stiffness and infer the gap\nenergy as a function of carrier density. Whereas a good agreement with the\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory is observed at high carrier doping, we\nfind that the suppression of Tc at low doping is controlled by the loss of\nmacroscopic phase coherence instead of electron pairing as in standard BCS\ntheory. We find that only a very small fraction of the electrons condenses into\nthe superconducting state and propose that this corresponds to the weak filling\nof a high-energy dxz/yz band, more apt to host superconductivity\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2017 15:34:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-21"}

This has led to ask whether it could\nhave decayed to its present value from an initial one commensurate with\nmicroscopical units. A mechanism that leads to such a decay is proposed herein.\nIt is based on assuming that $G$ may take different values within regions of\nthe universe separated by a novel kind of domain wall, a \"G-wall\". The idea is\nimplemented by introducing a gauge potential $A_{\\mu\\nu\\rho}$, and its\nconjugate $D$, which determines the value of $G$ as an integration constant\nrather than a fundamental constant. The value of $G$ jumps when one goes\nthrough a $G$-wall. The procedure extends one previously developed for the\ncosmological constant, but the generalization is far from straightforward: (i)\nThe intrinsic geometry of a $G$-wall is not the same as seen from its two\nsides, because the second law of black hole thermodynamics mandates that the\njump in $G$ must cause a discontinuity in the scale of length. (ii) The size of\nthe decay step in $G$ is controlled by a function $G(D)$ which may be chosen so\nas to diminish the value of $G$ towards the asymptote $G=0$, without fine\ntuning. It is shown that: (i) The dynamics of the gravitational field with $G$\ntreated as a dynamical variable, coupled to $G$-walls and matter, follows from\nan action principle, which is given. (ii) A particle that impinges on a\n$G$-wall may be refracted or reflected. (iii) The various forces between two\nparticles change when a $G$-wall is inserted in between them. (iv) $G$-walls\nmay be nucleated trough tunneling and thermal effects. The semiclassical\nprobabilities are evaluated. (v)~If the action principle is constructed\nproperly, the entropy of a black hole increases when the value of the\ngravitational constant is changed through the absorption of a G-wall by the\nhole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2017 15:46:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-26"}

Images in each set belong to the same identity.\nSince images in a set can be complementary, they hopefully lead to higher\naccuracy in practical applications. However, the quality of each sample cannot\nbe guaranteed, and samples with poor quality will hurt the metric. In this\npaper, the quality aware network (QAN) is proposed to confront this problem,\nwhere the quality of each sample can be automatically learned although such\ninformation is not explicitly provided in the training stage. The network has\ntwo branches, where the first branch extracts appearance feature embedding for\neach sample and the other branch predicts quality score for each sample.\nFeatures and quality scores of all samples in a set are then aggregated to\ngenerate the final feature embedding. We show that the two branches can be\ntrained in an end-to-end manner given only the set-level identity annotation.\nAnalysis on gradient spread of this mechanism indicates that the quality\nlearned by the network is beneficial to set-to-set recognition and simplifies\nthe distribution that the network needs to fit.

In this Letter we report the first observation of an anomalous\nneutron Halo scattering of HOPG. The scattering projects a ring onto the\ndetector with half cone angle of 12.4 degree that surprisingly persists to\nincident neutron wavelengths far beyond the Bragg cutoff for graphite (6.71 A).\nAt longer wavelengths the ring is clearly a doublet with a splitting roughly\nproportional to wavelength. While the ring centers at the beam position if the\nbeam is normal to the basal planes of HOPG, sample tilting results in the shift\nof the ring towards the same direction. The angle of ring shift is observed to\nbe less than the sample tilts, which is wavelength dependent with longer\nwavelengths providing larger shifts. Additionally, upon tilting, the ring\nbroadens and splits into a doublet at the low angle side with short wavelength\nneutrons whereas only subtle broadening is observed at longer wavelengths. The\nring broadens and weakens with decreasing HOPG quality. We also notice that the\nintensity at the ring positions scales with the sample thickness. The ring\nvanishes as the sample is cooled down to 30 K, suggesting that the lattice\ndynamics of graphite is one of the factors that cause the scattering ring. A\npossible interpretation by combining inelastic scattering and Yoneda scattering\nis proposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2017 20:24:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-13"}

Due to frequency detuning between the\ntwo Pierce oscillators, the first circuit showed no clear sign of noise-induced\nsynchronization. The second circuit, on the other hand, generated coherent\nwaveforms between different trials of the same noise injection.
