The second approach,\nregarded as an indirect approach employs learning algorithms and statistical\nanalysis on the whole crowd to achieve counting.

The\ncontrol design problem considers the reduced state space which excludes the\nangular velocity and orientation about the vertical body axis. The proposed\ncontroller enables the quadrotor to track the orientation of this axis, and\nconsequently any prescribed position trajectory using only three rotors. The\ncontrol design is carried out in two stages. First, in order to track the\nreduced attitude dynamics, a geometric controller with two input torques is\ndesigned on the Lie-Group $SO(3)$. This is then extended to $SE(3)$ by\ndesigning a saturation based feedback law, in order to track the center of mass\nposition with bounded thrust. The control law for the complete dynamics\nachieves exponential tracking for all initial conditions lying in an open-dense\nsubset. The novelty of the geometric control design is in its ability to\neffectively execute aggressive, global maneuvers despite complete loss of a\nrotor. Numerical simulations on models of a variable pitch and a conventional\nquadrotor have been presented to demonstrate the practical applicability of the\ncontrol design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Apr 2017 16:44:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-04"}

Our selection is based on a selection box in the $g-r$ vs.\n$r-z$ colour-colour space and a cut on the $g$-band magnitude, to favour\ngalaxies in the desired redshift range with strong [OII] emission. It provides\na target density of 200 deg$^{-2}$ on the North Galactic Cap (NGC) and of 240\ndeg$^{-2}$ on the South Galactic Cap (SGC), where we use a larger selection box\nbecause of deeper imaging. We demonstrate that this selection passes the eBOSS\nrequirements in terms of homogeneity. About 50,000 ELGs have been observed\nsince the observations have started in 2016, September. These roughly match the\nexpected redshift distribution, though the measured efficiency is slightly\nlower than expected. The efficiency can be increased by enlarging the redshift\nrange and with incoming pipeline improvement. The cosmological forecast based\non these first data predict $\\sigma_{D_V}/D_V = 0.023$, in agreement with\nprevious forecasts. Lastly, we present the stellar population properties of the\nELG SGC sample. Once observations are completed, this sample will be suited to\nprovide a cosmological analysis at $z \\sim 0.85$, and will pave the way for the\nnext decade of massive spectroscopic cosmological surveys, which heavily rely\non ELGs. The target catalogue over the SGC will be released along with DR14.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Apr 2017 18:08:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-30"}

In this study, we obtain an analytical expression for the\nLyapunov exponents that quantitatively predicts this trend. The sum of the\nexponents, which is the normalized rate of change of the signed-volume of a\nsmall cloud of particles, is correctly predicted to be negative and positive at\nsmall and large Stokes numbers, respectively, asymptoting to $\\tau Q$ as $\\tau\n\\to 0$ and $\\tau^{-1/2} |Q|^{1/4}$ as $\\tau \\to \\infty$, where $\\tau$ is the\nparticle relaxation time and $Q(\\tau)$ is the difference between the norm of\nthe rotation- and strain-rate tensors computed along the particle trajectory.\nAdditionally, the trajectory crossing is predicted only in hyperbolic flows\nwhere $Q<0$ for sufficiently inertial particles with a $\\tau$ that scales with\n$|Q|^{-1/2}$.

Our work yields the largest sample of\nsystems with a transiting giant exoplanet and coherently determined orbital,\nplanetary, and stellar parameters.

Indeed, the most eccentric planets have relatively large orbital\nseparations and/or high mass ratios, as expected from the equilibrium tide\ntheory.

It is shown that a strong\nmagnetic field has a large effect on the instability region, defining the\ncrust-core transition as a succession of stable and unstable regions due to the\nopening of new Landau levels. The effect of the anomalous magnetic moment is\nnon-negligible for fields larger than 10$^{15}$ G. The complexity of the crust\nat the transition to the core and the increase of the crust thickness may have\ndirect impact on the properties of neutrons stars related with the crust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Apr 2017 21:56:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-26"}

The paper discusses trading strategies for both\ncommodities and stocks but the main focus is on stock market trading at the New\nYork Stock Exchange.\n  Problem 1: Buy Low and Sell High. The buy low and sell high problem can be\nsummarized like this: suppose the price of a commodity or stock fluctuates\nindefinitely, is there any explicit strategy for a trader to \"ride the price\nwaves\" by buying low and selling high to eventually win even if price does not\nincrease?\n  Problem 2: \"Beat\" the Market. In Part 2, the trading system presented in Part\n1 is transformed into a strategy that always outperforms the market eventually.\n  Problem 3: Can a Trader Outperform a geometric Brownian Motion? The general\nbelief is that it is impossible to \"beat\" a GBM since technical analysis of\nhistorical prices is useless in predicting future prices. The last part of the\npaper shows that the answer to Problem 3 is actually a \"YES\", which is quite\nsurprising.\n  The trading strategies presented are based mainly on information obtained\nfrom the movements of waves and wavelets created by large and small\nfluctuations of market prices.

Concomitantly, the local density itself\nfluctuates in space. Therefore, one can imagine that even very small local\ndensity variations control the local glassy nature. Based on this perspective,\na model for describing growing length scale accompanying the vitrification is\nintroduced, in which we assume that in a subsystem whose density is above a\ncertain threshold value, $\\rho_{\\rm c}$, owing to steric constraints, particle\nrearrangements are highly suppressed for a sufficiently long time period\n($\\sim$ structural relaxation time). We regard such a subsystem as a glassy\ncluster. Then, based on the statistics of the subsystem-density, we predict\nthat with compression (increasing average density $\\rho$) at a fixed\ntemperature $T$ in supercooled states, the characteristic length of the\nclusters, $\\xi$, diverges as $\\xi\\sim(\\rho_{\\rm c}-\\rho)^{-2/d}$, where $d$ is\nthe spatial dimensionality. This $\\xi$ measures the average persistence length\nof the steric constraints in blocking the rearrangement motions and is\ndetermined by the subsystem density. Additionally, with decreasing $T$ at a\nfixed $\\rho$, the length scale diverges in the same manner as $\\xi\\sim(T-T_{\\rm\nc})^{-2/d}$, for which $\\rho$ is identical to $\\rho_{\\rm c}$ at $T=T_{\\rm c}$.\nThe exponent describing the diverging length scale is the same as the one\npredicted by some theoretical models and indeed has been observed in some\nsimulations and experiments. However, the basic mechanism for this divergence\nis different; that is, we do not invoke thermodynamic anomalies associated with\nthe thermodynamic phase transition as the origin of the growing length scale.\nWe further present arguements for the cooperative properties based on the\nclusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2017 00:40:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Dec 2017 22:41:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-07"}

We predict that the 3D-printed conductors can create\nmagnetic fields with gradients around 15 G/cm and passing through zero, as\nrequired for atom trapping, with Joule heating as low as 0.2 W.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2017 05:42:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-04"}

Out\nof intuitionism grew intuitionistic logic and the associated\nBrouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov interpretation by which 'there exists x' intuitively\nmeans 'an algorithm to compute x is given'. A number of schools of constructive\nmathematics were developed, inspired by Brouwer's intuitionism and invariably\nbased on intuitionistic logic, but with varying interpretations of what\nconstitutes an algorithm. This paper deals with the dichotomy between\nconstructive and non-constructive mathematics, or rather the absence of such an\n'excluded middle'. In particular, we challenge the 'binary' view that\nmathematics is either constructive or not. To this end, we identify a part of\nclassical mathematics, namely classical Nonstandard Analysis, and show it\ninhabits the twilight-zone between the constructive and non-constructive.\nIntuitively, the predicate 'x is standard' typical of Nonstandard Analysis can\nbe interpreted as 'x is computable', giving rise to computable (and sometimes\nconstructive) mathematics obtained directly from classical Nonstandard\nAnalysis.

However, travel-time measurements of the\nsubsurface meridional flow suffer from a variety of systematic errors, such as\na center-to-limb variation and an offset due to the P-angle uncertainty of\nsolar images. Here we apply the time-distance technique to contemporaneous\nmedium-degree Dopplergrams produced by SOHO/MDI and SDO/HMI to obtain the\ntravel-time difference caused by meridional circulation throughout the solar\nconvection zone. The P-angle offset in MDI images is measured by\ncross-correlating MDI and HMI images. The travel-time measurements in the\nsouth-north and east-west directions are averaged over the same observation\nperiod for the two data sets and then compared to examine the consistency of\nMDI and HMI travel times after correcting the systematic errors.\n  The offsets in the south-north travel-time difference from MDI data induced\nby the P-angle error gradually diminish with increasing travel distance.\nHowever, these offsets become noisy for travel distances corresponding to waves\nthat reach the base of the convection zone. This suggests that a careful\ntreatment of the P-angle problem is required when studying a deep meridional\nflow. After correcting the P-angle and the removal of the center-to-limb\neffect, the travel-time measurements from MDI and HMI are consistent within the\nerror bars for meridional circulation covering the entire convection zone. The\nfluctuations observed in both data sets are highly correlated and thus indicate\ntheir solar origin rather than an instrumental origin. Although our results\ndemonstrate that the ad hoc correction is capable of reducing the wide\ndiscrepancy in the travel-time measurements from MDI and HMI, we cannot exclude\nthe possibility that there exist other systematic effects acting on the two\ndata sets in the same way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2017 08:56:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-26"}

Then we determine the conditions under which there is a\nquantum phase transition with spontaneous symmetry breaking from a\nspin-balanced configuration to a spin-polarized one, an effect known as\nitinerant ferromagnetism. Interestingly, we find that the transition appears\nwhen the interaction energy per particle exceedes both the kinetic energy per\nparticle and the Rabi coupling energy. The itinerant ferromagnetism of the\npolarized phase is analyzed, obtaining the population imbalance as a function\nof interaction strength, Rabi coupling, and number density. Finally, the\ninclusion of a external harmonic confinement is investigated by adopting the\nlocal density approximation. We predict that a single atomic cloud can display\npopulation imbalance near the center of the trap and a fully balanced\nconfiguration at the periphery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2017 09:15:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-13"}

While several projects aim to build scalable and fast ML\nsystems, little work has addressed the pains of sourcing data and features for\nML tasks. Real-world relational databases typically have many tables (often,\ndozens) and data scientists often struggle to even obtain and join all possible\ntables that provide features for ML. In this context, Kumar et al. showed\nrecently that key-foreign key dependencies (KFKDs) between tables often lets us\navoid such joins without significantly affecting prediction accuracy--an idea\nthey called avoiding joins safely. While initially controversial, this idea has\nsince been used by multiple companies to reduce the burden of data sourcing for\nML. But their work applied only to linear classifiers. In this work, we verify\nif their results hold for three popular complex classifiers: decision trees,\nSVMs, and ANNs. We conduct an extensive experimental study using both\nreal-world datasets and simulations to analyze the effects of avoiding KFK\njoins on such models. Our results show that these high-capacity classifiers are\nsurprisingly and counter-intuitively more robust to avoiding KFK joins compared\nto linear classifiers, refuting an intuition from the prior work's analysis.

The\ncapability and limitations of this technique in handling liquids of extreme\nsurface tension and kinematic viscosity values are investigated both\nexperimentally and theoretically. The sublimating coating is capable of\nrepelling many viscous and low surface tension liquids, colloidal suspensions,\nand non-Newtonian fluids as well, displaying outstanding omniphobic properties.\nFinally, we demonstrate how sublimation can be used for liquid transport,\nmixing and drop coalescence, with a sublimating layer coated on an underlying\nsubstrate with prefabricated channels, conferring omniphobicity with a simple\nphysical approach, rather than a chemical one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2017 09:20:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-04"}

Compared to narrower and deeper networks, wide\nnetworks employ relatively less number of layers and have various important\nbenefits, such that they have less running time on parallel computing devices,\nand they are less affected by gradient vanishing problems. However, the\nparameter size of a wide network can be very large due to use of large width of\neach layer in the network. In order to keep the benefits of wide networks\nmeanwhile improve the parameter size and accuracy trade-off of wide networks,\nwe propose a binary tree architecture to truncate architecture of wide networks\nby reducing the width of the networks. More precisely, in the proposed\narchitecture, the width is continuously reduced from lower layers to higher\nlayers in order to increase the expressive capacity of network with a less\nincrease on parameter size. Also, to ease the gradient vanishing problem,\nfeatures obtained at different layers are concatenated to form the output of\nour architecture. By employing the proposed architecture on a baseline wide\nnetwork, we can construct and train a new network with same depth but\nconsiderably less number of parameters. In our experimental analyses, we\nobserve that the proposed architecture enables us to obtain better parameter\nsize and accuracy trade-off compared to baseline networks using various\nbenchmark image classification datasets. The results show that our model can\ndecrease the classification error of baseline from 20.43% to 19.22% on\nCifar-100 using only 28% of parameters that baseline has.

Last\nsix decades of radio astronomy research has led to the detection of thousands\nof radio galaxies. But only ~ 300 of them can be classified as GRGs. The\nreasons behind their large size and rarity are unknown. We carried out a\nsystematic search for these radio giants and found a large sample of GRGs. In\nthis paper, we report the discovery of 25 GRGs from NVSS, in the redshift range\n(z) ~ 0.07 to 0.67. Their physical sizes range from ~0.8 Mpc to ~4 Mpc. Eight\nof these GRGs have sizes greater than 2Mpc which is a rarity. In this paper,\nfor the first time, we investigate the mid-IR properties of the optical hosts\nof the GRGs and classify them securely into various AGN types using the WISE\nmid-IR colours. Using radio and IR data, four of the hosts of GRGs were\nobserved to be radio loud quasars that extend up to 2 Mpc in radio size. These\nGRGs missed detection in earlier searches possibly because of their highly\ndiffuse nature, low surface brightness and lack of optical data. The new GRGs\nare a significant addition to the existing sample that will contribute to\nbetter understanding of the physical properties of radio giants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2017 10:27:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Jun 2017 10:43:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-16"}

Spin-orbit\ncoupling is one of the key microscopic mechanisms to couple charge currents and\nspin polarizations. The Rashba spin-orbit coupling in a two-dimensional\nelectron gas has been shown to give rise to the inverse spin galvanic effect,\ni.e. the generation of a non-equilibrium spin polarization by a charge current.\nWhereas the Rashba model may be applied to the interpretation of experimental\nresults in many cases, in general in a given real physical system spin-orbit\ncoupling also occurs due other mechanisms such as Dresselhaus bulk inversion\nasymmetry and scattering from impurities. In this work we consider the inverse\nspin galvanic effect in the presence of Rashba, Dresselhaus and impurity\nspin-orbit scattering. We find that the size and form of the inverse spin\ngalvanic effect is greatly modified by the presence of the various sources of\nspin-orbit coupling. Indeed, spin-orbit coupling affects the spin relaxation\ntime by adding the Elliott-Yafet mechanism to the Dyakonov-Perel and,\nfurthermore, it changes the non-equilibrium value of the current-induced spin\npolarization by introducing a new spin generation torque. We use a diagrammatic\nKubo formula approach to evaluate the spin polarization-charge current response\nfunction.

The unexpected observation of $D$ excitons in two-photon absorption\nand of $F$ excitons in one-photon absorption has given evidence that the\ndispersion properties of the $\\Gamma_5^+$ orbital valence band is giving rise\nto a coupling of the yellow and green exciton series.

Our transition-based parser, which uses a\nnovel transition set and features based on bidirectional LSTMs, has value not\njust for UCCA parsing: its ability to handle more general graph structures can\ninform the development of parsers for other semantic DAG structures, and in\nlanguages that frequently use discontinuous structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2017 12:40:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2017 10:51:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-02"}

In\nthis work, strain-dependent phonon transport of recently-fabricated antimonene\n(Sb monolayer) under biaxial strain is investigated from a combination of\nfirst-principles calculations and the linearized phonon Boltzmann equation. It\nis found that the ZA dispersion of antimonene with strain less than -1\\% gives\nimaginary frequencies, which suggests that compressive strain can induce\nstructural instability. Experimentally, it is possible to enhance structural\nstability by tensile strain. Calculated results show that lattice thermal\nconductivity increases with strain changing from -1\\% to 6\\%, and lattice\nthermal conductivity at 6\\% strain is 5.6 times larger than that at -1\\% strain\nat room temperature. It is interesting that lattice thermal conductivity is in\ninverse proportion to buckling parameter $h$ in considered strain range. Such a\nstrain dependence of lattice thermal conductivity is attributed to enhanced\nphonon lifetimes caused by increased strain, while group velocities have a\ndecreased effect on lattice thermal conductivity with increasing strain. It is\nfound that acoustic branches dominate the lattice thermal conductivity over the\nfull strain range. The cumulative room-temperature lattice thermal conductivity\nat -1\\% strain converges to maximum with phonon mean free path (MFP) at 50 nm,\nwhile one at 6\\% strain becomes as large as 44 $\\mathrm{\\mu m}$, which suggests\nthat strain can give rise to very strong size effects on lattice thermal\nconductivity in antimonene.

The overall network security is\nmeasured by what we call the average risk exposure (ARE) from neighbors, which\nis proportional to the total (expected) number of attacks in the network.\n  We first show that there exists a unique pure-strategy Nash equilibrium of a\npopulation game. Then, we prove that as the agents with larger degrees in the\ndependence graph see higher risks than those with smaller degrees, the overall\nnetwork security deteriorates in that the ARE experienced by agents increases\nand there are more attacks in the network. Finally, using this finding, we\ndemonstrate that the effects of network mixing on ARE depend on the (cost)\neffectiveness of security measures available to agents; if the security\nmeasures are not effective, increasing assortativity of dependence graph\nresults in higher ARE. On the other hand, if the security measures are\neffective at fending off the damages and losses from attacks, increasing\nassortativity reduces the ARE experienced by agents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2017 13:24:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-04"}

We deal with a simplified mean\nestimation problem consisting of an additive model with gaussian noise and mean\nthat is in a restricted, finite hypothesis space. This restriction simplifies\nthe mean estimation problem into a selection problem of combinatorial nature.\nAlthough the hypothesis space is finite, its size is exponential in the\ndimension of the mean. In limited data settings and when the size of the\nhypothesis space depends on the amount of data or on the dimension of the data,\nchoosing an approximation set of hypotheses is a desirable approach.

Moreover, we prove that, provided the\n$d$-dimensional marginal distribution of the features has a finite $\\rho$th\nmoment for some $\\rho > 4$ (as well as other regularity conditions), a local\nchoice of $k$ can yield a rate of convergence of the excess risk of\n$O(n^{-4/(d+4)})$, where $n$ is the sample size, whereas for the standard\n$k$-nearest neighbour classifier, our theory would require $d \\geq 5$ and $\\rho\n> 4d/(d-4)$ finite moments to achieve this rate. These results motivate a new\n$k$-nearest neighbour classifier for semi-supervised learning problems, where\nthe unlabelled data are used to obtain an estimate of the marginal feature\ndensity, and fewer neighbours are used for classification when this density\nestimate is small. Our worst-case rates are complemented by a minimax lower\nbound, which reveals that the local, semi-supervised $k$-nearest neighbour\nclassifier attains the minimax optimal rate over our classes for the excess\nrisk, up to a subpolynomial factor in $n$. These theoretical improvements over\nthe standard $k$-nearest neighbour classifier are also illustrated through a\nsimulation study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2017 15:34:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Aug 2018 11:16:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 18 May 2019 10:49:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-21"}

To provide computational interpretations of these\naspects of synaptic plasticity, we formulate unsupervised learning as a\nzero-sum game between Hebbian excitation and anti-Hebbian inhibition in a\nneural network model. The game formalizes the intuition that Hebbian excitation\ntries to maximize correlations of neurons with their inputs, while anti-Hebbian\ninhibition tries to decorrelate neurons from each other. We further include a\nmodel of synaptic competition, which enables a neuron to eliminate all\nconnections except those from its most strongly correlated inputs.

While the general form of SCT contains\ninfinitely many free parameters, the data permit us to reduce the number to\nseven, only three of which are active over the entire inertial range. Of these\nthree, one parameter characterizes the variance of the mean field noise in SCT\nand another characterizes the rate in the large deviations of the mean. The\nthird parameter is the decay exponent of the Fourier variables in the Fourier\nexpansion of the noise, which characterizes the smoothness of the turbulent\nvelocity. SCT compares favorably with velocity structure functions measured in\nthe experiment. We considered even-order structure functions ranging in order\nfrom two to eight as well as the third-order structure functions at five\nTaylor-Reynolds numbers (Rl) between 110 and 1450.

However, its performance has in practice been found\nto be limited by drifts. To remedy this, drift-free DFPC-OR (DF-DFCB-OR) has\nrecently been proposed. Suggested methodologies for realization of a specific\ntype of DF-DFCB-OR, termed Fast Switching DFCB-OR (FS-DFCB-OR), have been\npresented in an accompanying work. This paper scrutinizes the performance and\nthe limitations of both DF- and FS-DFCB-OR for assessments of refractivity and\ngas density, in particular their precision, accuracy, and temperature\ndependence. It is shown that both refractivity and gas density can be assessed\nby FS-DFCB-OR with a precision in the 10$^{-9}$ range under STP conditions. It\nis demonstrated that the absolute accuracy is mainly limited by the accuracy by\nwhich the instantaneous deformation of the cavity or the higher order virial\ncoefficients can be assessed. It is also shown that the internal accuracy, i.e.\nthe accuracy by which the system can be characterized with respect to an\ninternal standard, can be several orders of magnitude better than the absolute.\nIt is concluded that the temperature dependence of FS-DFCB-OR is exceptionally\nsmall, typically in the 10$^{-8}$ to 10$^{-7}$/C range, and primarily caused by\nthermal expansion of the FPC-spacer material. Finally, this paper discusses\nmeans on how to design a FS-DFCB-or system for optimal performance and\nepitomizes the conclusions of this and our accompanying works regarding both\nDF- and FS-DFCB-OR in terms of performance and provides an outlook for both\ntechniques.

However, drifts of the FP cavity\noften limit its performance. We show that by the use of two narrow-linewidth\nfiber lasers locked to two high finesse cavities and Allan-Werle plots that\ndrift-free DFPC-OR can be obtained for short measurement times (for which the\ndrifts of the cavity can be disregarded). Based on this, a novel strategy,\ntermed fast switching DFPC-OR (FS-DFPC-OR), is presented. A set of novel\nmethodologies for assessment of both gas density and flow rates (in particular\nfrom small leaks) that are not restricted by the conventional limitations\nimposed by the drifts of the cavity are presented. The methodologies deal with\nassessments in both open and closed (finite-sized) compartments. They\ncircumvent the problem with volumetric expansion, i.e. that the gas density in\na measurement cavity is not the same as that in the closed external compartment\nthat should be assessed, by performing a pair of measurements in rapid\nsuccession; the first one serves the purpose of assessing the density of the\ngas that has been transferred into the measurement cavity by the gas\nequilibration process, while the 2nd is used to automatically calibrate the\nsystem with respect to the relative volumes of the measurement cavity and the\nexternal compartment. The methodologies for assessments of leak rates comprise\ntriple cavity evacuation assessments, comprising two measurements performed in\nrapid succession, supplemented by a 3rd measurement a certain time thereafter.\nA clear explanation of why the technique has such a small temperature\ndependence is given.

Numerical simulations of such wear has seen\nincreasing attention over the last years. They have the potential to be much\nfaster and less expensive than the in vitro tests in use today. While it is\nunlikely that in silico tests will replace actual physical tests in the\nforeseeable future, a judicious combination of both approaches can help making\nboth implant design and pre-clinical testing quicker and more cost-effective.\n  The challenge today for the design of simulation methods is to obtain results\nthat convey quantitative information, and to do so quickly and reliably. This\ninvolves the choice of mathematical models as well as the numerical tools used\nto solve them. The correctness of the choice can only be validated by comparing\nwith experimental results.\n  In this paper we present finite element simulations of the wear in TKRs\nduring the gait cycle standardized in the ISO 14243-1 document, used for\ncompliance testing in several countries. As the ISO 14243-1 standard is\nprecisely defined and publicly available, it can serve as an excellent\nbenchmark for comparison of wear simulation methods.

We compare our simulation results with\nthe experimental data from physical tests using two different actual TKRs, each\ntest being performed three times.
