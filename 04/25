The\ntheory of collapse of scalar field configurations into compact objects has been\nextensively studied regarding to boson stars, in this work we extrapolate such\nresults for models of galactic halos hosting central SMBHs.

In the atmosphere and the oceans,\nrotation and stratification result in a flow that can be approximated as\ntwo-dimensional at very large scales, but which requires considering\nthree-dimensional effects to fully describe turbulent transport processes and\nnon-linear phenomena. Motions can thus be classified into two classes: fast\nmodes consisting of inertia-gravity waves, and slow quasi-geostrophic modes for\nwhich the Coriolis force and horizontal pressure gradients are close to\nbalance. In this paper we review previous results on the strength of the\ninverse cascade in rotating and stratified flows, and then present new results\non the effect of varying the strength of rotation and stratification (measured\nby the ratio $N/f$ of the Brunt-V\\\"ais\\\"ala frequency to the Coriolis\nfrequency) on the amplitude of the waves and on the flow quasi-geostrophic\nbehavior.

We then use\nthe spatio-temporal spectrum, and characterization of the flow temporal and\nspatial scales, to show that in this range slow modes dominate the dynamics,\nwhile the strength of the waves (and their relevance in the flow dynamics) is\nweaker.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2017 16:50:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Jan 2018 19:06:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-19"}

Instead of using cutoffs to\nregularize 1-loop divergences, the dimensional regularization scheme is used.\nLarge momenta effects are removed from physical amplitudes by adjusting the\nparameters of the appropriate counterterms. The use of a SU(N)-covariant\ngauge-fixing procedure is stressed. 1-loop contributions of KK excitations are\ncharacterized by discrete KK sums and continuous momenta sums, which can\ndiverge. Two types of UVs are identified, one arising from poles of the gamma\nfunction and associated with short-distance effects in the usual 4-dimensional\nspacetime manifold, and the other emerging either from poles of the\n1-dimensional Epstein function or from the gamma function, and corresponding to\nshort-distance effects in the compact manifold. We address the cases of 5 and\n4+n dimensions (n>1) separately. In 5 dimensions the 1-dimensional Epstein\nfunction is convergent, so the usual counterterm renormalizes the vacuum\npolarization function. For 4+n dimensions, the 1-dimensional Epstein function\nis divergent, so renormalization is implemented by interactions of canonical\ndimension higher than 4, already present in the effective theory. The\npolarization function is renormalized using both mass-dependent and\nmass-independent schemes, with extra-dimensions effects decoupling in the\nformer case but not in the latter. The beta function is calculated for an\narbitrary number of extra dimensions. Our main result is that Yang-Mills theory\nremains perturbative at 1 loop, which is in disagreement with the results\nobtained in the literature by using a cutoff regulator, which suggest that\nYang-Mills theory in more than 4 dimensions ceases to be perturbative. We\nemphasize the advantages of a mass-dependent scheme in this type of theories,\nin which decoupling is manifest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2017 17:24:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Jan 2020 16:52:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2020 22:59:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

Our main event\nconsisted of a loop spanning ~ 15 arcsec, from the umbral-penumbral boundary to\nan opposite polarity region outside the penumbra.

When only regional data\nare available, or when data quality varies strongly with geographic location,\nthe inversion problem becomes severely ill-posed. In those cases, adopting\nexplicitly local methods is to be preferred over adapting global ones (e.g., by\nregularization). Here, we develop the theory behind a procedure to invert for\nplanetary potential fields from vector observations collected within a\nspatially bounded region at varying satellite altitude. Our method relies on\nthe construction of spatiospectrally localized bases of functions that mitigate\nthe noise amplification caused by downward continuation (from the satellite\naltitude to the planetary surface) while balancing the conflicting demands for\nspatial concentration and spectral limitation. Solving simultaneously for\ninternal and external fields in the same setting of regional data availability\nreduces internal-field artifacts introduced by downward-continuing unmodeled\nexternal fields, as we show with numerical examples. The AC-GVSF are optimal\nlinear combinations of vector spherical harmonics. Their construction is not\naltogether very computationally demanding when the concentration domains (the\nregions of spatial concentration) have circular symmetry, e.g., on spherical\ncaps or rings - even when the spherical-harmonic bandwidth is large. Data\ninversion proceeds by solving for the expansion coefficients of truncated\nfunction sequences, by least-squares analysis in a reduced-dimensional space.\nHence, our method brings high-resolution regional potential-field modeling from\nincomplete and noisy vector-valued satellite data within reach of contemporary\ndesktop machines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2017 17:39:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

It may be summarised by an exponent\ntriple $(1/2,1/3,2/3)$ representing local interface fluctuation, local\nroughness (or inward deviation) and convex hull facet length. The three effects\narise, for example, in droplets in planar Ising models (Alexander, '01,\nHammond, '11,'12). In this article, we offer a new perspective on this\nphenomenon. We consider directed last passage percolation model in the plane, a\nparadigmatic example in the KPZ universality class, and constrain the\nmaximizing path under the additional requirement of enclosing an atypically\nlarge area. The interface suffers a constraint of parabolic curvature as\nbefore, but now its local structure is the KPZ fixed point polymer's rather\nthan Brownian. The local interface fluctuation exponent is thus two-thirds\nrather than one-half. We prove that the facet lengths of the constrained path's\nconvex hull are governed by an exponent of $3/4$, and inward deviation by an\nexponent of $1/2$. That is, the exponent triple is now $(2/3,1/2,3/4)$ in place\nof $(1/2,1/3,2/3)$. This phenomenon appears to be shared among various\nisoperimetrically extremal circuits in local randomness.

Simulations\nwith GW effects cut-off above the turbopause and included in the entire\nthermosphere have been conducted. GWs appreciably impact the mean circulation\nand cool the thermosphere down by up to 12-18%. GWs significantly affect the\nwinds modulated by the diurnal migrating tide, in particular in the\nlow-latitude mesosphere and lower thermosphere and in the high-latitude\nthermosphere. These effects depend on the mutual correlation of the diurnal\nphases of the GW forcing and tides: GWs can either enhance or reduce the tidal\namplitude. In the low-latitude MLT, the correlation between the direction of\nthe deposited GW momentum and the tidal phase is positive due to propagation of\na broad spectrum of GW harmonics through the alternating winds. In the Northern\nHemisphere high-latitude thermosphere, GWs act against the tide due to an\nanti-correlation of tidal wind and GW momentum, while in the Southern\nhigh-latitudes they weakly enhance the tidal amplitude via a combination of a\npartial correlation of phases and GW-induced changes of the circulation.

The iteration can be implemented in any\nnorm over $\\mathbb{R}^n$, but it is normally used in the $L_2$ norm. The choice\nof norm not only affects the desired balance condition, but also defines the\niterated balancing step itself.\n  In this paper we focus on Osborne's iteration in any $L_p$ norm, where $p <\n\\infty$. We design a specific implementation of Osborne's iteration in any\n$L_p$ norm that converges to a strictly $\\epsilon$-balanced matrix in\n$\\tilde{O}(\\epsilon^{-2}n^{9} K)$ iterations, where $K$ measures, roughly, the\n{\\em number of bits} required to represent the entries of the input matrix.\n  This is the first result that proves that Osborne's iteration in the $L_2$\nnorm (or any $L_p$ norm, $p < \\infty$) strictly balances matrices in polynomial\ntime. This is a substantial improvement over our recent result (in SODA 2017)\nthat showed weak balancing in $L_p$ norms. Previously, Schulman and Sinclair\n(STOC 2015) showed strong balancing of Osborne's iteration in the $L_\\infty$\nnorm.

Titan phase curves (a\nrepresentation of overall brightness vs. Sun-object-observer phase angle) have\nbeen published over a limited range of phase angles and spectral passbands [5,\n6]. Such information has been key to the study of the stratification,\nmicrophysics and aggregate nature of Titan's atmospheric haze [7, 8], and has\ncomplemented the spatially-resolved observations first showing that the haze\nscatters efficiently in the forward direction [7, 9]. Here we present Cassini\nImaging Science Subsystem whole-disk brightness measurements of Titan from\nultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths. The observations reveal that Titan's\ntwilight (loosely defined as the view when the phase angle 150deg) outshines\nits daylight at various wavelengths. From the match between measurements and\nmodels, we show that at even larger phase angles the back-illuminated moon will\nappear much brighter than when fully illuminated. This behavior is unique to\nTitan in our solar system, and is caused by its extended atmosphere and the\nefficient forward scattering of sunlight by its atmospheric haze. We infer a\nsolar energy deposition rate (for a solar constant of 14.9 Wm-2) of\n(2.84+/-0.11)x10^14 W, consistent to within 1-2 standard deviations with\nTitan's time-varying thermal emission spanning 2007- 2013 [10, 11].

The generation and control of such states by\nengineering the dipolar interactions between atoms can enable new tools for\natomic-based technologies. Atom-atom interactions in free space are limited in\nrange, since the amplitude of the radiated field decreases inversely with\ndistance. When the field is confined to one dimension it enables infinite-range\ninteractions. This has been observed for atoms in an optical cavity, but\nremains to be proven in one-dimensional waveguides, where the extent of the\ninteractions is not limited by the cavity size. Here we present the first\nreport of infinite-range interactions between macroscopically separated atomic\ndipoles mediated by an optical waveguide. This is evidenced by the collective\nradiative decay of a single photon distributed between distant atoms. We use\ncold $^{87}$Rb atoms in the vicinity of a single-mode optical nanofiber (ONF)\nthat coherently exchange evanescently coupled photons through the ONF mode. In\nparticular, we observe super-radiance of a few atoms separated by hundreds of\nresonant wavelengths. This effect is not possible for atoms separated by more\nthan a wavelength interacting through free space. The same platform allows us\nto measure sub-radiance, a rarely observed effect, presenting a novel tool for\nquantum optics. This result constitutes a proof-of-principle for collective\nbehavior of macroscopically delocalized atomic states, a crucial element for\nnew proposals in quantum information and many-body physics. Given the\napplication of one-dimensional waveguides in photonic-based quantum\ntechnologies, we envision infinite-range interactions as the natural next step\ntowards interconnecting quantum systems on scales suitable for practical\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2017 22:48:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Jun 2017 00:16:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-14"}

A graph-based approach naturally suits these scenarios, where a\ncontextual graph captures traits that characterize a population, while the\nspecific brain activity patterns are utilized as a multivariate signal at the\nnodes. Graph neural networks have shown improvements in inferencing with\ngraph-structured data.

Also, to represent both top-down and\nbottom-up information of the expressions, a centralisation technique is used to\nimprove the reduced partial trees. Besides, symbolic association vectors and\nrule application records are used to improve the rewriting processes.\nExperimental results reveal that the algebraic reasoning examples can be\naccurately learnt only if the feedforward neural network has enough hidden\nlayers. Also, the centralisation technique, the symbolic association vectors\nand the rule application records can reduce error rates of reasoning. In\nparticular, the above approaches have led to 4.6% error rate of reasoning on a\ndataset of linear equations, differentials and integrals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2017 01:10:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-13"}

(2014) showed in 3D SPH simulations that\ntilted discs in binary systems can be unstable to the development of global,\ndamped Kozai-Lidov (KL) oscillations in which the discs exchange tilt for\neccentricity. We investigate the linear stability of KL modes for tilted\ninviscid discs under the approximations that the disc eccentricity is small and\nthe disc remains flat. By using 1D equations, we are able to probe regimes of\nlarge ratios of outer to inner disc edge radii that are realistic for binary\nsystems of hundreds of AU separations and are not easily probed by\nmulti-dimensional simulations. For order unity binary mass ratios, KL\ninstability is possible for a window of disc aspect ratios H/r in the outer\nparts of a disc that roughly scale as (n_b/n)^2 < H/r < n_b/n, for binary\norbital frequency n_b and orbital frequency n at the disc outer edge. We\npresent a framework for understanding the zones of instability based on the\ndetermination of branches of marginally unstable modes.

However, despite its importance for memory\nstorage and retrieval, spiking network models of the CA3 to date are relatively\nsmall-scale, and exist as only proof-of-concept models. Specifically, how\nneurogenesis in the dentate gyrus affects memory encoding and retrieval in the\nCA3 is not studied in such spiking models. Our work is the first to develop a\nbiologically plausible spiking neural network model of hippocampal memory\nencoding and retrieval, with at least an order-of-magnitude more neurons than\nprevious models. It is also the first to investigate the effect of neurogenesis\non CA3 memory encoding and retrieval. Using such a model, we first show that a\nrecently developed plasticity model is crucial for good encoding and retrieval.\nNext, we show how neural properties related to neurogenesis and neuronal death\nenhance storage and retrieval of associative memories in the CA3. In\nparticular, we show that without neurogenesis, increasing number of CA3 neurons\nare recruited by each new memory stimulus, resulting in a corresponding\nincrease in inhibition and poor memory retrieval as more memories are encoded.\nNeurogenesis, on the other hand, maintains the number of CA3 neurons recruited\nper stimulus, and enables the retrieval of recent memories, while forgetting\nthe older ones. Our model suggests that structural plasticity (provided by\nneurogenesis and apoptosis) is required in the hippocampus for memory encoding\nand retrieval when the network is overloaded; synaptic plasticity alone does\nnot suffice. The above results are obtained from an exhaustive study in the\ndifferent plasticity models and network parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2017 03:30:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-26"}

If the number of the\npotential confounders ($p$) is larger than the number of observations ($n$),\nthen direct control for all potential confounders is infeasible. Existing\napproaches for dimension reduction and penalization are generally aimed at\npredicting the outcome, and are less suited for estimation of causal effects.\nUnder standard penalization approaches (e.g. Lasso), if a variable $X_j$ is\nstrongly associated with the treatment $T$ but weakly with the outcome $Y$, the\ncoefficient $\\beta_j$ will be shrunk towards zero thus leading to confounding\nbias.\n  Under the assumption of a linear model for the outcome and sparsity, we\npropose continuous spike and slab priors on the regression coefficients\n$\\beta_j$ corresponding to the potential confounders $X_j$.

A planet cools down from\na hot initial state to the present state by losing energy through radiative\nemission from its atmosphere. Thus, the atmospheric properties affect the\nplanetary cooling rate. Previous theories of giant planet cooling assume that\nthe atmospheric composition is unchanged throughout evolution. Planet formation\ntheories, however, suggest that the atmospheres especially of ice giants are\nrich in heavy elements in the early stages. Those heavy elements include\ncondensable species such as water, ammonia, and methane, which are expected to\nhave a great impact on atmospheric temperature and, thus, radiative emission\nthrough latent heat release. In this study we investigate the effect of such\ncondensation on the planetary emission flux and quantify the impact on the\ncooling timescale. We then demonstrate that the latent heat of those species\nkeeps the atmosphere hot and thus the emission flux high for billions of years,\nresulting in acceleration of the cooling of ice giants. This sheds light on the\nlong-standing problem that Uranus is much less bright than theoretically\npredicted and is different in brightness from Neptune in spite of similarity in\nmass and radius. Also, we find that young ice giants with highly enriched\natmospheres are much brighter in mid-infrared than those with unenriched\natmospheres.

Here we combine those\ntools to test the mono-scalar-tensor theory of Damour and Esposito-Far{\\`e}se\n(DEF), which predicts nonperturbative scalarization phenomena for neutron stars\n(NSs). First, applying Markov-chain Monte Carlo techniques, we use the absence\nof dipolar radiation in the pulsar-timing observations of five binary systems\ncomposed of a NS and a white dwarf, and eleven equations of state (EOSs) for\nNSs, to derive the most stringent constraints on the two free parameters of the\nDEF scalar-tensor theory. Since the binary-pulsar bounds depend on the NS mass\nand the EOS, we find that current pulsar-timing observations leave\nscalarization windows, i.e., regions of parameter space where scalarization can\nstill be prominent. Then, we investigate if these scalarization windows could\nbe closed and if pulsar-timing constraints could be improved by\nlaser-interferometer GW detectors, when spontaneous (or dynamical)\nscalarization sets in during the early (or late) stages of a binary NS (BNS)\nevolution. For the early inspiral of a BNS carrying constant scalar charge, we\nemploy a Fisher matrix analysis to show that Advanced LIGO can improve\npulsar-timing constraints for some EOSs, and next-generation detectors, such as\nthe Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope, will be able to improve those\nbounds for all eleven EOSs. Using the late inspiral of a BNS, we estimate that\nfor some of the EOSs under consideration the onset of dynamical scalarization\ncan happen early enough to improve the constraints on the DEF parameters\nobtained by combining the five binary pulsars. Thus, in the near future the\ncomplementarity of pulsar timing and direct observations of GWs on the ground\nwill be extremely valuable in probing gravity theories in the strong-field\nregime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2017 06:59:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Sep 2017 10:00:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-03"}

Initially, all disks have radius $0$, and they grow at constant, but\npossibly different, speeds. Whenever two disks touch, the one with the higher\nindex disappears. The goal is to determine the elimination order, i.e., the\norder in which the disks disappear. We provide the first general subquadratic\nalgorithm for this problem. Our solution extends to other shapes (e.g.,\nrectangles), and it works in any fixed dimension.\n  We also describe an alternative algorithm that is based on quadtrees.

By formulating integrated dictionary elements spanning bands of\nthe considered parameter space, one may efficiently find and discard large\nparts of the parameter space not active in the signal. After each iteration,\nthe zero-valued parts of the dictionary may be discarded to allow a refined\ndictionary to be formed around the active elements, resulting in a zoomed\ndictionary to be used in the following iterations. Implementing this scheme\nallows for more accurate estimates, at a much lower computational cost, as\ncompared to directly forming a larger dictionary spanning the whole parameter\nspace or performing a zooming procedure using standard dictionary elements.\nDifferent from traditional dictionaries, the wideband dictionary allows for the\nuse of dictionaries with fewer elements than the number of available samples\nwithout loss of resolution. The technique may be used on both one- and\nmulti-dimensional signals, and may be exploited to refine several traditional\nsparse estimators, here illustrated with the LASSO and the SPICE estimators.\nNumerical examples illustrate the improved performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2017 08:34:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 15 Oct 2017 13:41:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}

However, most of\nthe advances in the design of high speed wireless multiple-input multiple\noutput (MIMO) systems are based on information-theoretic principles that\ndemonstrate how to efficiently transmit signals conforming to Gaussian\ndistribution. Although the Gaussian signal is capacity-achieving, signals\nconforming to discrete constellations are transmitted in practical\ncommunication systems. As a result, this paper is motivated to provide a\ncomprehensive overview on MIMO transmission design with discrete input signals.\nWe first summarize the existing fundamental results for MIMO systems with\ndiscrete input signals. Then, focusing on the basic point-to-point MIMO\nsystems, we examine transmission schemes based on three most important criteria\nfor communication systems: the mutual information driven designs, the mean\nsquare error driven designs, and the diversity driven designs. Particularly, a\nunified framework which designs low complexity transmission schemes applicable\nto massive MIMO systems in upcoming 5G wireless networks is provided in the\nfirst time. Moreover, adaptive transmission designs which switch among these\ncriteria based on the channel conditions to formulate the best transmission\nstrategy are discussed. Then, we provide a survey of the transmission designs\nwith discrete input signals for multiuser MIMO scenarios, including MIMO uplink\ntransmission, MIMO downlink transmission, MIMO interference channel, and MIMO\nwiretap channel. Additionally, we discuss the transmission designs with\ndiscrete input signals for other systems using MIMO technology. Finally,\ntechnical challenges which remain unresolved at the time of writing are\nsummarized and the future trends of transmission designs with discrete input\nsignals are addressed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2017 09:52:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-26"}

This paper studies the wireless surveillance of a two-hop\nsuspicious communication link by a half-duplex legitimate monitor. By exploring\nthe suspicious link's two-hop nature, the monitor can adaptively choose among\nthe following three eavesdropping modes to improve the eavesdropping\nperformance: (I) \\emph{passive eavesdropping} to intercept both hops to decode\nthe message collectively, (II) \\emph{proactive eavesdropping} via {\\emph{noise\njamming}} over the first hop, and (III) \\emph{proactive eavesdropping} via\n{\\emph{hybrid jamming}} over the second hop. In both proactive eavesdropping\nmodes, the (noise/hybrid) jamming over one hop is for the purpose of reducing\nthe end-to-end communication rate of the suspicious link and accordingly making\nthe interception more easily over the other hop. Under this setup, we maximize\nthe eavesdropping rate at the monitor by jointly optimizing the eavesdropping\nmode selection as well as the transmit power for noise and hybrid jamming.\nNumerical results show that the eavesdropping mode selection significantly\nimproves the eavesdropping rate as compared to each individual eavesdropping\nmode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2017 10:59:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-26"}

About 120 Be/X-ray binaries (BeXBs) are known in the Small\nMagellanic Cloud (SMC); about half of them are pulsating with periods from a\nfew to hundreds of seconds. SXP 1323 is one of the longest-period pulsars known\nin this galaxy. Aims. SXP 1323 is in the field of view of a large set of\ncalibration observations that we analyse systematically, focusing on the time\nanalysis, in search of periodic signals. Methods. We analyse all available\nX-ray observations of SXP 1323 from Suzaku, XMM-Newton, and Chandra, in the\ntime range from 1999 to the end of 2016. We perform a Lomb-Scargle periodogram\nsearch in the band 2.5-10 keV on all observations to detect the neutron star\nspin period and constrain its long-term evolution. We also perform an orbital\nperiod search on the long-term light curve, merging all datasets. Results. We\nreport the discovery of a 26.188+-0.045 d period analysing data from Suzaku,\nXMM-Newton, and Chandra, which confirms the optical period derived from the\nOptical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) data. If this corresponds to\nthe orbital period, this would be very short with respect to what is expected\nfrom the spin/orbital period relationship. We furthermore report on the spin\nperiod evolution in the last years. The source is spinning-up with an average\nrate of Pdot/P of 0.018 yr-1, decreasing from 1340 to 1100 s, in the period\nfrom 2006 to the end of 2016, which is also extreme with respect to the other\nBe/X-ray pulsars. From 2010 to the end of 2014, the pulse period is not clearly\ndetectable, although the source was still bright. Conclusions. SXP 1323 is a\npeculiar BeXB due to its long pulse period, rapid spin-up for several years,\nand short orbital period. A continuous monitoring of the source in the next\nyears is necessary to establish the long-term behaviour of the spin period.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2017 11:53:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-21"}

In empirical models, UV SSI variability\nis usually determined by fitting the rotational variability in activity indices\nto that in measurements. Such models have to date relied on ordinary least\nsquares regression, which ignores the uncertainty in the activity indices. In\nan advance from earlier efforts, the uncertainty in the activity indices is\naccounted for in EMPIRE by the application of an error-in-variables regression\nscheme, making the resultant UV SSI variability more robust.

The central result of this paper is that by sampling a\nsignificantly smaller subset of vertices and using simple least squares, we can\nreconstruct the second-order statistics of the graph signal from the subsampled\nobservations, and more importantly, without any spectral priors. To this end,\nboth a nonparametric approach as well as parametric approaches including moving\naverage and autoregressive models for the graph power spectrum are considered.\nThe results specialize for undirected circulant graphs in that the graph nodes\nleading to the best compression rates are given by the so-called minimal sparse\nrulers. A near-optimal greedy algorithm is developed to design the subsampling\nscheme for the non-parametric and the moving average models, whereas a\nparticular subsampling scheme that allows linear estimation for the\nautoregressive model is proposed.

Compared with the adaptive BDDC algorithms for conforming\nGalerkin approximations, our algorithm is more simple, because there is not any\ncontinuity constraints at subdomain vertices in the mortar method involved in\nthis paper. The condition number of the preconditioned system is proved to be\nbounded above by a user-defined tolerance and a constant which is dependent on\nthe maximum number of interfaces per subdomain, and independent of the mesh\nsize and the contrast of the given coefficients.

Each such a change is called a local bifurcation. We\nderive novel results with regards to truncated parametric normal form\nclassification of the generalized cusp plants. Then, we suggest effective\nnonlinear bifurcation control law designs for precisely locating and accurately\ncontrolling many different types of bifurcations for two measurable plants from\nthis family. The first is a general quadratic plant with a possible multi-input\nlinear controller while the second is a Z_2-equivariant general plant with\npossible multi-input linear (Z_2-symmetry preserving) and quadratic\n(symmetry-breaking) controllers. The bifurcations include from primary to\nquinary bifurcations of either of the following types: saddle-node,\ntranscritical and pitchfork of equilibria, Z_2-equivariant bifurcations of\nmultiple limit cycles through Hopf, homoclinic, heteroclinic, saddle-node, and\nsaddle-connection, and finally their one-parameter symmetry breaking\nbifurcations. Using our parametric normal form analysis, we propose a new\napproach for efficient treatment of tracking and regulating engineering\nproblems with smooth manoeuvering possiblities. Due to the nonlinearity of a\nship maneuvering characteristic, there is a need for a controller design in a\nship steering system so that the ship follows a desired sea route. The results\nin bifurcation control analysis are applied to two nonlinear ship course models\nfor such controller designs.

I present a comprehensive study, which considers habitability\nnot only on planets, but on satellites, as well. My research focuses on three\nclosely related topics. The first one is the circumstellar habitable zone,\nwhich is usually used as a first proxy for determining the habitability of a\nplanet around the host star. The word habitability is used in the sense that\nliquid water, which is essential for life as we know it, may be present on the\nplanetary surface. Whether the planet is habitable or not, its moon might have\na suitable surface temperature for holding water reservoirs, providing that\ntidal heating is in action. Tidal heating is generated inside the satellite and\nits source is the strong gravitational force of the nearby planet. The second\ntopic of my research explores tidal heating and the habitability of extra-solar\nmoons with and without stellar radiation and other related energy sources. Life\nis possible to form even on icy planetary bodies, inside tidally heated\nsubsurface oceans. The third topic probes the possibility of identifying an\nice-covered satellite from photometric observations. A strong indication of\nsurface ice is the high reflectance of the body, which may be measured when the\nmoon disappears behind the host star, so its reflected light is blocked out by\nthe star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2017 13:41:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-26"}

We then use the Forecasting a CME's Altered Trajectory (ForeCAT) model\nfor nonradial CME dynamics driven by magnetic forces, to simulate the\ndeflection and rotation of the seven CMEs. We find good agreement between the\nForeCAT results and the reconstructed CME positions and orientations. The CME\ndeflections range in magnitude between 10 degrees and 30 degrees.

These three CMEs\nall deflect primarily northward, with some minor eastward deflection, and\nrotate counterclockwise. Their final positions and orientations, however,\nrespectively differ by 20 degrees and 30 degrees. This variation in deflection\nand rotation results from differences in the CME expansion and radial\npropagation close to the Sun, as well as the CME mass.

It can be also found that the metallicity\ngradients in isolated spiral galaxies NGC\\,2403 and NGC\\,300 are similar and\nobviously steeper than that in M33, when the metallicity gradients are\nexpressed in ${\\rm dex}\\,R_{\\rm 25}^{-1}$. The similar metallicity gradients in\nNGC\\,2403 and NGC\\,300 indicate that they may experience similar chemical\nevolutionary histories. The principal epoch of star formation on the discs of\nNGC\\,2403 and NGC\\,300 is earlier than that on the disc of M33, and the mean\nage of stellar populations along the discs of both NGC\\,2403 and NGC\\,300 is\nolder than that of M33. Our results indicates that the evolution and star\nformation history of a galaxy indeed depends on its local environment, at least\nfor galaxies with stellar mass of $10^{9.2}\\,\\rm M_{\\odot}\\sim10^{9.7}\\,\\rm\nM_{\\odot}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2017 13:55:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-19"}

We discuss\nthe implementation ofJANUS and present tests of its accuracy and speed by\nperforming and analyzing long-term integrations of the Solar System. We show\nthat JANUS is fast and accurate enough to tackle a broad class of dynamical\nproblems. We also discuss the practical and philosophical implications of\nrunning exactly time-reversible simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2017 14:32:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Sep 2017 14:35:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-29"}

However, NIRT models frequently suffer from estimation\ninstability because of the great flexibility of nonparametric ICCs, especially\nwhen there is only a small amount of item-response data. To improve the\nestimation accuracy, we propose a novel NIRT model constrained by monotone\nhomogeneity and smoothness based on ordered latent classes. Our smoothness\nconstraints avoid overfitting of nonparametric ICCs by keeping them close to\nlogistic curves. We also implement a tailored expectation--maximization\nalgorithm to calibrate our smoothness-constrained NIRT model efficiently. We\nconducted computational experiments to assess the effectiveness of our\nsmoothness-constrained model in comparison with the common two-parameter\nlogistic model and the monotone-homogeneity model. The computational results\ndemonstrate that our model obtained more accurate estimation results than did\nthe two-parameter logistic model when the latent abilities of examinees for\nsome test items followed bimodal distributions. Moreover, our model\noutperformed the monotone-homogeneity model because of the effect of the\nsmoothness constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2017 15:16:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-26"}
