For galaxies hosting an active galactic nucleus (AGN)\nwith jets, the interaction of the jets with the winds of the stars within can\nlead to particle acceleration, and to extended high-energy emitting regions. We\ncompute the non-thermal emission produced by the jet flow shocked by stellar\nwinds on the jet scale, far from the jet-star direct interaction region. First,\nprescriptions for the winds of the relevant stellar populations in different\ntypes of galaxies are obtained. The scenarios adopted include galaxies with\ntheir central regions dominated by old or young stellar populations, and with\njets of different power. Then, we estimate the available energy to accelerate\nparticles in the jet shock, and compute the transport and energy evolution of\nthe accelerated electrons, plus their synchrotron and inverse Compton emission,\nin the shocked flow along the jet. A significant fraction of the jet energy,\n$\\sim 0.1-10$\\%, can potentially be available for the particles accelerated in\njet-wind shocks in the studied cases.

In wireless\nnetworks, nodes communicate in synchronous rounds. In each round a node can\neither transmit a message to all its neighbors, or stay silent and listen. At\nthe receiving end, a node $v$ hears a message from a neighbor $w$ in a given\nround, if $v$ listens in this round, and if $w$ is its only neighbor that\ntransmits in this round.

This paper considers a promise-problem\nvariant of CSPs called PCSPs. A PCSP over a finite set of pairs of constraints\n$\\Gamma$ consists of a pair $(\\Psi_P, \\Psi_Q)$ of CSPs with the same set of\nvariables such that for every $(P, Q) \\in \\Gamma$, $P(x_{i_1}, ..., x_{i_k})$\nis a clause of $\\Psi_P$ if and only if $Q(x_{i_1}, ..., x_{i_k})$ is a clause\nof $\\Psi_Q$. The promise problem $\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\Gamma)$ is to\ndistinguish, given $(\\Psi_P, \\Psi_Q)$, between the cases $\\Psi_P$ is\nsatisfiable and $\\Psi_Q$ is unsatisfiable. Many natural problems including\napproximate graph and hypergraph coloring can be placed in this framework.\n  This paper is motivated by the pursuit of understanding the computational\ncomplexity of Boolean promise CSPs. As our main result, we show that\n$\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\Gamma)$ exhibits a dichotomy (it is either polynomial\ntime solvable or $\\mathsf{NP}$-hard) when the relations in $\\Gamma$ are\nsymmetric and allow for negations of variables. We achieve our dichotomy\ntheorem by extending the weak polymorphism framework of Austrin, Guruswami, and\nH\\aa stad [FOCS '14] which itself is a generalization of the algebraic approach\nto study CSPs. In both the algorithm and hardness portions of our proof, we\nincorporate new ideas and techniques not utilized in the CSP case.\n  Furthermore, we show that the computational complexity of any promise CSP\n(over arbitrary finite domains) is captured entirely by its weak polymorphisms,\na feature known as Galois correspondence, as well as give necessary and\nsufficient conditions for the structure of this set of weak polymorphisms.

By storing parts of\nthe popular files at the mobile users, users can locate some of their requested\nfiles in their own caches or the caches at their neighbors. In the latter case,\nwhen a user receives files from its neighbors, device-to-device (D2D)\ncommunication is enabled. D2D communication underlaid with cellular networks is\nalso a new paradigm for the upcoming 5G wireless systems. By allowing a pair of\nadjacent D2D users to communicate directly, D2D communication can achieve\nhigher throughput, better energy efficiency and lower traffic delay. In this\nwork, we propose a very efficient caching algorithm for D2D-enabled cellular\nnetworks to minimize the average transmission delay. Instead of searching over\nall possible solutions, our algorithm finds out the best <file,user> pairs,\nwhich provide the best delay improvement in each loop to form a caching policy\nwith very low transmission delay and high throughput. This algorithm is also\nextended to address a more general scenario, in which the distributions of\nfading coefficients and values of system parameters potentially change over\ntime. Via numerical results, the superiority of the proposed algorithm is\nverified by comparing it with a naive algorithm, in which all users simply\ncache their favorite files.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2017 18:30:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-10"}

Most importantly, taking the difference\nbetween the rates obtained from two opposite orientations of the drive, and\nintegrating over a proper drive-frequency range, provides a direct measure of\nthe topological Chern number of the populated band ($\\nu$): this \"differential\nintegrated rate\" is directly related to the strength of the driving field\nthrough the quantized coefficient $\\eta_0\\!=\\!\\nu /\\hbar^2$.

However, system level implementation has three challenges.\nFirst, a classic dilemma is that recognition requires current reading for short\nvoltage$-$spikes which is disturbed by large voltage$-$waveforms that are\nsimultaneously applied on the same memristor for real$-$time learning i.e. the\nsimultaneous read$-$write dilemma. Second, the hardware needs to exactly\nreplicate software implementation for easy adaptation of algorithm to hardware.\nThird, the devices used in hardware simulations must be realistic. In this\npaper, we present an approach to address the above concerns. First, the\nlearning and recognition occurs in separate arrays simultaneously in\nreal$-$time, asynchronously $-$ avoiding non$-$biomimetic clocking based\ncomplex signal management. Second, we show that the hardware emulates software\nat every stage by comparison of SPICE (circuit$-$simulator) with MATLAB\n(mathematical SNN algorithm implementation in software) implementations. As an\nexample, the hardware shows 97.5 per cent accuracy in classification which is\nequivalent to software for a Fisher$-$Iris dataset. Third, the STDP is\nimplemented using a model of synaptic device implemented using HfO2 memristor.\nWe show that an increasingly realistic memristor model slightly reduces the\nhardware performance (85 per cent), which highlights the need to engineer RRAM\ncharacteristics specifically for SNN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2017 20:25:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-03"}

A crucial design\nfactor in evolutionary deep intelligence is the genetic encoding scheme used to\nsimulate heredity and determine the architectures of offspring networks. In\nthis study, we take a deeper look at the notion of synaptic cluster-driven\nevolution of deep neural networks which guides the evolution process towards\nthe formation of a highly sparse set of synaptic clusters in offspring\nnetworks. Utilizing a synaptic cluster-driven genetic encoding, the\nprobabilistic encoding of synaptic traits considers not only individual\nsynaptic properties but also inter-synaptic relationships within a deep neural\nnetwork. This process results in highly sparse offspring networks which are\nparticularly tailored for parallel computational devices such as GPUs and deep\nneural network accelerator chips.

Our constructions achieve unconditional (perfect) zero\nknowledge in the Interactive Probabilistically Checkable Proof (IPCP) model of\nKalai and Raz [KR08] (the prover first sends a PCP oracle, then the prover and\nverifier engage in an Interactive Proof in which the verifier may query the\nPCP).\n  Our main result is a zero knowledge variant of the sumcheck protocol [LFKN92]\nin the IPCP model. The sumcheck protocol is a key building block in many IPs,\nincluding the protocol for polynomial-space computation due to Shamir [Sha92],\nand the protocol for parallel computation due to Goldwasser, Kalai, and\nRothblum [GKR15]. A core component of our result is an algebraic commitment\nscheme, whose hiding property is guaranteed by algebraic query complexity lower\nbounds [AW09,JKRS09].

The conventional micro-manufacturing techniques are capable of\neither producing microchannel or nanochannel networks for a fluidic application\nbut lack proficiency in the production of an integrated micro-nanochannel\nnetwork with a smooth transition from micro-to-nano scale dimension. In\naddition, these techniques possess limitations such as heavy initial\ninvestment, sophistication in operation and scale-up capabilities. Therefore,\nthe current paper demonstrates the combination of micro/nanotechnologies to\ndesign and develop a biomimetic 3-D integrated micro-nanochannel network in\nPDMS device for solute exchange. We have used 3-D printer, a scalable\ntechnology, to design and manufacture micro-mold having fractal-shaped\nfeatures. Further, electrospinning was used to deposit nanofibrous network on\nthe fractal mold. Subsequent micro-molding with PDMS was used to obtain\nfractal-shaped microchannels integrated with embedded nanofibers. Henceforth,\nsolvent etching of nanofibers followed by bonding of thin PDMS membrane\ngenerated by spin coating to open end of channels leads to the formation of\nfunctional microdevices. These PDMS devices mimic the natural vasculature of a\nliving system, where fractal-shaped microchannels will assist in efficient\nfluid flow and the site of nanovascular network participates in heat/mass\ntransport operations. Further, dye flow propounds the functionality of such\ndevices. Our study hence proposes a simple and scalable hybrid microtechnolgy\nto fabricate fluidic devices having multiscale architecture.

A two-stage learning framework\nis widely adopted by most existing methods based on Deep Neural Network (DNN):\nThe first learning stage is to generate separate representation for each\nmodality, and the second learning stage is to get the cross-modal common\nrepresentation. However, the existing methods have three limitations: (1) In\nthe first learning stage, they only model intra-modality correlation, but\nignore inter-modality correlation with rich complementary context. (2) In the\nsecond learning stage, they only adopt shallow networks with single-loss\nregularization, but ignore the intrinsic relevance of intra-modality and\ninter-modality correlation. (3) Only original instances are considered while\nthe complementary fine-grained clues provided by their patches are ignored. For\naddressing the above problems, this paper proposes a cross-modal correlation\nlearning (CCL) approach with multi-grained fusion by hierarchical network, and\nthe contributions are as follows: (1) In the first learning stage, CCL exploits\nmulti-level association with joint optimization to preserve the complementary\ncontext from intra-modality and inter-modality correlation simultaneously. (2)\nIn the second learning stage, a multi-task learning strategy is designed to\nadaptively balance the intra-modality semantic category constraints and\ninter-modality pairwise similarity constraints. (3) CCL adopts multi-grained\nmodeling, which fuses the coarse-grained instances and fine-grained patches to\nmake cross-modal correlation more precise.

One\npromising technique to handle the challenge of partial faces is to design face\ndetectors based on facial segments. In this paper two different approaches of\nfacial segment-based face detection are discussed, namely, proposal-based\ndetection and detection by end-to-end regression. Methods that follow the first\napproach rely on generating face proposals that contain facial segment\ninformation. The three detectors following this approach, namely Facial\nSegment-based Face Detector (FSFD), SegFace and DeepSegFace, discussed in this\npaper, perform binary classification on each proposal based on features learned\nfrom facial segments. The process of proposal generation, however, needs to be\nhandled separately, which can be very time consuming, and is not truly\nnecessary given the nature of the active authentication problem. Hence a novel\nalgorithm, Deep Regression-based User Image Detector (DRUID) is proposed, which\nshifts from the classification to the regression paradigm, thus obviating the\nneed for proposal generation. DRUID has an unique network architecture with\ncustomized loss functions, is trained using a relatively small amount of data\nby utilizing a novel data augmentation scheme and is fast since it outputs the\nbounding boxes of a face and its segments in a single pass.

We detected\nthe 183 GHz H2O line towards all the stars with peak flux densities greater\nthan 100 Jy, including a new detection from VY CMa. Towards all 5 targets, the\nwater line had indications of being due to maser emission and had higher peak\nflux densities than for the SiO lines. The SiO lines appear to originate from\nboth thermal and maser processes. Comparison with simulations and models\nindicate that 183 GHz maser emission is likely to extend to greater radii in\nthe circumstellar envelopes than SiO maser emission and to similar or greater\nradii than water masers at 22, 321 and 325 GHz. We speculate that a prominent\nblue-shifted feature in the W Hya 183 GHz spectrum is amplifying the stellar\ncontinuum, and is located at a similar distance from the star as mainline OH\nmaser emission. From a comparison of the individual polarizations, we find that\nthe SiO maser linear polarization fraction of several features exceeds the\nmaximum fraction allowed under standard maser assumptions and requires strong\nanisotropic pumping of the maser transition and strongly saturated maser\nemission. The low polarization fraction of the H2O maser however, fits with the\nexpectation for a non-saturated maser. 183 GHz H2O masers can provide strong\nprobes of the mass loss process of evolved stars.

Addressing diagnosability in an\napproximate sense is primarily motivated by the fact that system outputs in\nconcrete applications are measured by sensors that introduce measurement\nerrors. Consequently, it is not possible to detect exactly if the state of the\nsystem has reached or not the set of faulty states. In order to check\napproximate diagnosability on the class of nonlinear systems we use tools from\nformal methods.

Motivated by the fact that most\nwork on hierarchical clustering was based on providing algorithms, rather than\noptimizing a specific objective, Dasgupta framed similarity-based hierarchical\nclustering as a combinatorial optimization problem, where a `good' hierarchical\nclustering is one that minimizes some cost function. He showed that this cost\nfunction has certain desirable properties.\n  We take an axiomatic approach to defining `good' objective functions for both\nsimilarity and dissimilarity-based hierarchical clustering. We characterize a\nset of \"admissible\" objective functions (that includes Dasgupta's one) that\nhave the property that when the input admits a `natural' hierarchical\nclustering, it has an optimal value.\n  Equipped with a suitable objective function, we analyze the performance of\npractical algorithms, as well as develop better algorithms. For\nsimilarity-based hierarchical clustering, Dasgupta showed that the divisive\nsparsest-cut approach achieves an $O(\\log^{3/2} n)$-approximation. We give a\nrefined analysis of the algorithm and show that it in fact achieves an\n$O(\\sqrt{\\log n})$-approx.

For dissimilarity-based hierarchical\nclustering, we show that the classic average-linkage algorithm gives a factor 2\napprox., and provide a simple and better algorithm that gives a factor 3/2\napprox..\n  Finally, we consider `beyond-worst-case' scenario through a generalisation of\nthe stochastic block model for hierarchical clustering.

When an\natom is exposed to an intense x-ray pulse generated by an x-ray free-electron\nlaser (XFEL), it is ionized to a highly charged ion via a sequence of\nsingle-photon ionization and accompanying relaxation processes, and its final\ncharge state is limited by the last ionic state that can be ionized by a\nsingle-photon ionization.

There exist\nseveral approaches to recognize image pleasantness: (1) computer vision, and\n(2) psychophysical signals. For natural images, computer vision approaches have\nnot been as successful as for abstract paintings and is lagging behind the\npsychophysical signals like eye movements. Despite better results, the\nscalability of eye movements is adversely affected by the sensor cost. While\nthe introduction of affordable sensors have helped the scalability issue by\nmaking the sensors more accessible, the application of such sensors in a\nloosely controlled human-computer interaction setup is not yet studied for\naffective image tagging. On the other hand, deep convolutional neural networks\nhave boosted the performance of vision-based techniques significantly in recent\nyears. To investigate the current status in regard to affective image tagging,\nwe (1) introduce a new eye movement dataset using an affordable eye tracker,\n(2) study the use of deep neural networks for pleasantness recognition, (3)\ninvestigate the gap between deep features and eye movements. To meet these\nends, we record eye movements in a less controlled setup, akin to daily\nhuman-computer interaction. We assess features from eye movements, visual\nfeatures, and their combination. Our results show that (1) recognizing natural\nimage pleasantness from eye movement under less restricted setup is difficult\nand previously used techniques are prone to fail, and (2) visual class\ncategories are strong cues for predicting pleasantness, due to their\ncorrelation with emotions, necessitating careful study of this phenomenon.

In this\npaper we introduce an extension of the QBX scheme in 2D denoted AQBX - adaptive\nquadrature by expansion - which combines QBX with an algorithm for automated\nselection of parameters, based on a target error tolerance. A key component in\nthis algorithm is the ability to accurately estimate the numerical errors in\nthe coefficients of the expansion. Combining previous results for flat panels\nwith a procedure for taking the panel shape into account, we derive such error\nestimates for arbitrarily shaped boundaries in 2D that are discretized using\npanel-based Gauss-Legendre quadrature. Applying our scheme to numerical\nsolutions of Dirichlet problems for the Laplace and Helmholtz equations, and\nalso for solving these equations, we find that the scheme is able to satisfy a\ngiven target tolerance to within an order of magnitude, making it useful for\npractical applications.

Unfortunately, this has been observed after cumbersome and\nexpensive manual annotations, on very restricted populations, limiting the\nscope of the resulting claims. With this position paper, we want to sketch the\nmain steps of the very first systematic analysis, driven by social signal\nprocessing techniques, of the relationship between clothing and social signals,\nboth sent and perceived. Thanks to human parsing technologies, which exhibit\nhigh robustness owing to deep learning architectures, we are now capable to\nisolate visual patterns characterising a large types of garments.

State-to-state and\ninitial-state-specific rate coefficients are computed in the kinetic\ntemperature range 10-3000~K for the inelastic, exchange, abstraction and\ndissociative recombination processes using accurate potential energy surfaces\nand the best scattering methods. Good agreement, within a factor of 2, is found\nbetween the experimental and theoretical thermal rate coefficients, except for\nthe reaction of CH$^+$ with H atoms at kinetic temperatures below 50~K.

The recognition problem of $I(F)$,\nknown as Induced Subgraph Isomorphism (for the pattern graph $F$), is solvable\nin time $O(n^{W[F]})$. Motivated by this fact, we are interested in determining\nor estimating the value of $W[F]$. Using Olariu's characterization of paw-free\ngraphs, we show that $I(K_3+e)$ is definable by a first-order sentence of\nquantifier depth 3, where $K_3+e$ denotes the paw graph.

This paper studies\nan AmBC system by leveraging the ambient orthogonal frequency division\nmultiplexing (OFDM) modulated signals in the air. We first model such AmBC\nsystem from a spread-spectrum communication perspective, upon which a novel\njoint design for BD waveform and receiver detector is proposed. The BD symbol\nperiod is designed to be in general an integer multiplication of the OFDM\nsymbol period, and the waveform for BD bit `0' maintains the same state within\na BD symbol period, while the waveform for BD bit `1' has a state transition in\nthe middle of each OFDM symbol period within a BD symbol period. In the\nreceiver detector design, we construct the test statistic that cancels out the\ndirect-link interference by exploiting the repeating structure of the ambient\nOFDM signals due to the use of cyclic prefix. For the system with a\nsingle-antenna receiver, the maximum-likelihood detector is proposed to recover\nthe BD bits, for which the optimal threshold is obtained in closed-form\nexpression. For the system with a multi-antenna receiver, we propose a new test\nstatistic, and derive the optimal detector.

We find that the grain with\nmirror symmetry experiences negligible MATs due to its mirror-symmetry\ngeometry. Three highly irregular shapes can produce strong MATs which exhibit\nsome generic properties as radiative torques, while three weakly irregular\nshapes produce less efficient MATs. We then study grain alignment by MATs for\nthe different angles between the drift velocity and the ambient magnetic field,\nfor paramagnetic and superparamagnetic grains assuming efficient internal\nrelaxation. We find that for HIS grains, MATs can align subsonically drifting\ngrains in the same way as radiative torques, with low-J and high-J attractors.\nFor supersonic drift, MATs can align grains with low-J and high-J attractors,\nanalogous to radiative alignment by anisotropic radiation.

The formulation is based upon\nconsistent couple stress theory, which features a skew-symmetric couple-stress\npseudo-tensor. For general anisotropic thermoelastic material, there is not\nonly thermal strain deformation, but also thermal mean curvature deformation.\nInterestingly, in this size-dependent multi-physics model, the thermal\ngoverning equation is independent of the deformation. However, the mechanical\ngoverning equations depend on the temperature field. First, thermal and\nmechanical weak forms and reciprocal theorems are developed for this general\nsize-dependent thermoelastic theory. Then, an integral equation formulation for\nthe three-dimensional isotropic case is derived, along with the corresponding\nsingular infinite space fundamental solutions or kernel functions. Remarkably,\nfor isotropic materials within this theory, there is no thermal mean curvature\ndeformation, and the thermoelastic effect is solely the result of thermal\nstrain deformation. As a result, the size-dependent behavior is specified\nentirely by a single characteristic length scale parameter, while the thermal\ncoupling is defined in terms of the thermal expansion coefficient, as in the\nclassical theory of steady state isotropic thermoelasticity. This\nsimplification permits the development of the required kernel functions from\npreviously defined fundamental solutions for isotropic media.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2017 23:49:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-11"}

The\nmain reasons behind such a gap arise from natural complications in research and\ndevelopment in this area: the distribution of data may be a sensitive issue;\nsoftware frameworks are difficult to install and maintain; Test protocols may\ninvolve a potentially large set of intricate steps which are difficult to\nhandle. Given the raising complexity of research challenges and the constant\nincrease in data volume, the conditions for achieving reproducible research in\nthe domain are also increasingly difficult to meet.\n  To bridge this gap, we built an open platform for research in computational\nsciences related to pattern recognition and machine learning, to help on the\ndevelopment, reproducibility and certification of results obtained in the\nfield. By making use of such a system, academic, governmental or industrial\norganizations enable users to easily and socially develop processing\ntoolchains, re-use data, algorithms, workflows and compare results from\ndistinct algorithms and/or parameterizations with minimal effort. This article\npresents such a platform and discusses some of its key features, uses and\nlimitations.
