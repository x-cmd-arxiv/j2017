Purpose: 40Ar is larger than 12C, and one expects nuclear\neffects to play a bigger role in reactions. We present inclusive differential\nand total cross section results for charged-current neutrino scattering on 40Ar\nand perform a comparison with 12C, 16O and 56Fe targets, to find out about the\nA-dependent behavior of model predictions.

Globular clusters host stars with chemical peculiarities.

We investigate the effects of different initial helium\ncontents on the properties of white dwarfs such as their masses, compositions,\nand the time since their formation. Results. In a globular cluster at a given\nage, the He enrichment implies lower initial masses for stars at a given phase.\nThus it leads to a decrease of the masses of white dwarfs reaching the cooling\nsequence. In addition the He enrichment increases the total mass and number of\nwhite dwarfs and eventually allows the presence of He white dwarf from single\nprogenitors. Conclusions. The low He enrichment determined in most globular\nclusters with different methods results in negligible effects on the white\ndwarf properties.

We revisit\nthe physics of resonance capture via convergent disk-driven migration. We point\nout that for planet spacings typical of stable configurations for Kepler\nsystems, the planets can routinely maintain a small but nonzero eccentricity\ndue to gravitational perturbations from their neighbors. Together with the\nupper limit on the migration rate needed for capture, the finite eccentricity\ncan make resonance capture difficult or impossible in Sun-like systems for\nplanets smaller than ~Neptune-sized. This mass limit on efficient capture is\nbroadly consistent with observed exoplanet pairs that have mass determinations:\nof pairs with the heavier planet exterior to the lighter planet -- which would\nhave been undergoing convergent migration in their disks -- those in or nearly\nin resonance are much more likely to have total mass greater than two Neptune\nmasses than to have smaller masses. The agreement suggests that the observed\npaucity of resonant pairs around sun-like stars may simply arise from a small\nresonance capture probability for lower-mass planets. Planet pairs that thereby\navoid resonance capture are much less likely to collide in an eventual close\napproach than to simply migrate past one another to become a divergently\nmigrating pair with the lighter planet exterior.

The details of this suppression depend on the DM\nparticle nature, allowing for a direct link between DM models and astrophysical\nobservations. However, most of the astrophysical constraints obtained so far\nrefer to a very specific shape of the power suppression, corresponding to\nthermal warm dark matter (WDM), i.e., candidates with a Fermi-Dirac or\nBose-Einstein momentum distribution. In this work we introduce a new analytical\nfitting formula for the power spectrum, which is simple yet flexible enough to\nreproduce the clustering signal of large classes of non-thermal DM models,\nwhich are not at all adequately described by the oversimplified notion of WDM.\nWe show that the formula is able to fully cover the parameter space of sterile\nneutrinos (whether resonantly produced or from particle decay), mixed cold and\nwarm models, fuzzy dark matter, as well as other models suggested by effective\ntheory of structure formation (ETHOS).

In\nthis work we use high resolution 3-dimensional (3D) radiation-hydrodynamic\nsimulations with the code Enzo, equipped with adaptive ray tracing module\nMoray, to investigate radiation-regulated BH accretion of cold gas. Our\nsimulations reproduce findings from an earlier generation of 1D/2D simulations:\nthe accretion powered UV and X-ray radiation forms a highly ionized bubble,\nwhich leads to suppression of BH accretion rate characterized by quasi-periodic\noutbursts.

They are obtained by taking equivalent codes, for\nexample the generalized Reed Solomon codes, or by using the so-called subfield\nsubcode method, which leads to Alternant codes and Goppa codes over the\nunderlying prime field, or over some intermediate subfield. The main advantages\nof these constructions is to preserve both the minimum distance and the\ndecoding algorithm of the underlying Reed Solomon code. In this paper, we\npropose a generalization of the subfield subcode construction by introducing\nthe notion of subspace subcodes and a generalization of the equivalence of\ncodes which leads to the notion of generalized subspace subcodes. When the\ndimension of the selected subspaces is equal to one, we show that our approach\ngives exactly the family of the codes obtained by equivalence and subfield\nsubcode technique. However, our approach highlights the links between the\nsubfield subcode of a code defined over an extension field and the operation of\npuncturing the $q$-ary image of this code. When the dimension of the subspaces\nis greater than one, we obtain codes whose alphabet is no longer a finite\nfield, but a set of r-uples. We explain why these codes are practically as\nefficient for applications as the codes defined on an extension of degree r. In\naddition, they make it possible to obtain decodable codes over a large alphabet\nhaving parameters previously inaccessible.

On the other hand, when we fix the\nPlanck mass bias using the constraints from Penna-Lima et al., based on weak\nlensing measurements, we obtain a positive velocity bias $b_v \\gtrsim 0.9$ at\n$3\\sigma$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2017 20:01:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

The effect of wall-friction is analysed\nby comparing three separate cases, in which the cylinders are either suddenly\nmade no-slip or stress-free.

In the first stage, the decay is dominated by large-scale rolls.\nCounterintuitively, when these rolls fade away, if the flow inertia is small a\nredistribution of energy occurs, the energy of the azimuthal velocity behaves\nnon-monotonically: first decreasing by almost two orders of magnitude, and then\nincreasing during the redistribution. The second stage is dominated by\nnon-normal transient growth of perturbations in the axial (spanwise) direction.\nOnce this mechanism is exhausted, the flow enters the final life stage, viscous\ndecay, which is dominated by wall-friction. We show that this stage can be\nmodeled by a one-dimensional heat equation, and that self-similar velocity\nprofiles collapse onto the theoretical solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2017 20:08:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Sep 2017 15:58:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-08"}

These\nschemes can largely be categorized into two classes, namely uncoded prefetching\nschemes and coded prefetching schemes. While uncoded prefetching schemes in\ngeneral offer order-wise optimal performance, coded prefetching schemes often\nhave better performance at the low cache memory regime. The significant\ndifferences in the coding components between the two classes may leave the\nimpression that they are largely unrelated. In this work, we provide a\nconnection between the uncoded prefetching scheme proposed by Maddah Ali and\nNiesen (and its improved version by Yu et al) and the coded prefetching scheme\nproposed by Tian and Chen. A critical observation is first given where a coding\ncomponent in the Tian-Chen scheme can be replaced by a binary .code, which\nenables us to view the two schemes as the extremes of a more general scheme. An\nexplicit example is given to show that the intermediate operating points of\nthis general scheme can in fact provide new memory-rate tradeoff points\npreviously not known to be achievable in the literature. This new general\ncoding scheme is then presented and analyzed rigorously, which yields a new\ninner bound to the memory-rate tradeoff for the caching problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2017 20:28:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Dec 2017 22:57:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 22 Dec 2017 13:12:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-25"}

There are several missing predictor\nvalues for most patients, which in the health sciences is the norm, rather than\nthe exception. A Bayesian approach is presented that addresses many of the\nshortcomings to standard approaches to missing predictors: (i) treatment of the\nuncertainty due to imputation is straight-forward in the Bayesian paradigm,\n(ii) the predictor distribution is flexibly modeled as an infinite normal\nmixture with latent variables to explicitly account for discrete predictors\n(i.e., as in multivariate probit regression models), and (iii) certain missing\nnot at random situations can be handled effectively by allowing the indicator\nof missingness into the predictor distribution only to inform the distribution\nof the missing variables. The proposed approach also has the benefit of\nproviding a distribution for the prediction, including the uncertainty inherent\nin the imputation. Therefore, we can ask questions such as: is it possible this\nindividual is at high risk but we are missing too much information to know for\nsure? How much would we reduce the uncertainty in our risk prediction by\nobtaining a particular missing value? This approach is applied to the BPR\nproblem resulting in excellent predictive capability to identify deteriorating\npatients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2017 21:02:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-27"}

The second-moment properties of Hermite polynomials reveal a\nweakly orthogonal system when obtained for a general Gaussian probability\nmeasure.

The optimality of the generalized PCE and the\napproximation quality due to truncation are discussed. New analytical formulae\nare proposed to calculate the mean and variance of a generalized PCE\napproximation of a general output variable in terms of the expansion\ncoefficients and statistical properties of Hermite polynomials. However, unlike\nin the classical PCE, calculating the coefficients of the generalized PCE\nrequires solving a coupled system of linear equations.

These events show a median deviation in radiants between\nradar and optical determinations of 1.5 degrees, with 1/3 of events having\nradiant agreement to less than one degree. MAARSY tends to record average\nspeeds roughly 0.5 km/s and 1.3 km higher than optical records, in part due to\nthe higher sensitivity of MAARSY as compared to the optical instruments. More\nthan 98% of all head echoes are not detected with the optical system. Using\nthis non-detection ratio and the known limiting sensitivity of the cameras, we\nestimate that the limiting meteoroid detection mass of MAARSY is in the 10-9 kg\nto 10-10 kg (astronomical limiting meteor magnitudes of +11 to +12) appropriate\nto speeds from 30-60 km/s.

In classical\nmolecular replacement, it is common to estimate the magnitudes of the unknown\nstructure as twice the measured magnitudes minus the magnitudes of the\nhomologous structure, a procedure known as `twicing'.

Although the presence of several characteristic times\nassociated with the dissipation of different phase space structures is\nrecovered in both the cases of the nonlinear and the linearized operators, the\ninfluence of these times is different in the two cases. In the linearized\noperator case, the recovered characteristic times are systematically larger\nthan in the fully nonlinear operator case, this suggesting that fine velocity\nstructures are dissipated slower if nonlinearities are neglected in the\ncollisional operator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2017 09:07:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

Automatic speech recognition\nfocuses on interpreting the audio signals, although the video can provide\ninformation that is complementary to the audio. Exploiting the visual\ninformation, however, has proven challenging. On one hand, researchers have\nreported that the mapping between phonemes and visemes (visual units) is\none-to-many because there are phonemes which are visually similar and\nindistinguishable between them. On the other hand, it is known that some people\nare very good lip-readers (e.g: deaf people). We study the limit of visual only\nspeech recognition in controlled conditions. With this goal, we designed a new\ndatabase in which the speakers are aware of being read and aim to facilitate\nlip-reading. In the literature, there are discrepancies on whether\nhearing-impaired people are better lip-readers than normal-hearing people.\nThen, we analyze if there are differences between the lip-reading abilities of\n9 hearing-impaired and 15 normal-hearing people. Finally, human abilities are\ncompared with the performance of a visual automatic speech recognition system.\nIn our tests, hearing-impaired participants outperformed the normal-hearing\nparticipants but without reaching statistical significance.

However, if we repeat\nthe comparison in terms of phonemes both obtained very similar recognition\nrates, just above 50%.

Automatic speech\nrecognition focuses on interpreting the audio signals, but it has been\ndemonstrated that video can provide information that is complementary to the\naudio. Thus, the study of automatic lip-reading is important and is still an\nopen problem. One of the key challenges is the definition of the visual\nelementary units (the visemes) and their vocabulary. Many researchers have\nanalyzed the importance of the phoneme to viseme mapping and have proposed\nviseme vocabularies with lengths between 11 and 15 visemes. These viseme\nvocabularies have usually been manually defined by their linguistic properties\nand in some cases using decision trees or clustering techniques. In this work,\nwe focus on the automatic construction of an optimal viseme vocabulary based on\nthe association of phonemes with similar appearance. To this end, we construct\nan automatic system that uses local appearance descriptors to extract the main\ncharacteristics of the mouth region and HMMs to model the statistic relations\nof both viseme and phoneme sequences. To compare the performance of the system\ndifferent descriptors (PCA, DCT and SIFT) are analyzed. We test our system in a\nSpanish corpus of continuous speech. Our results indicate that we are able to\nrecognize approximately 58% of the visemes, 47% of the phonemes and 23% of the\nwords in a continuous speech scenario and that the optimal viseme vocabulary\nfor Spanish is composed by 20 visemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2017 09:34:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-27"}

Since battery\nreplacement of sensor nodes is generally difficult, long-term monitoring can be\nonly achieved if the operation of the WSN nodes contributes to a long WSN\nlifetime. Two prominent techniques to long WSN lifetime are i) optimal sensor\nactivation and ii) efficient data gathering and forwarding based on compressive\nsensing. These techniques are feasible only if the activated sensor nodes\nestablish a connected communication network (connectivity constraint), and\nsatisfy a compressive sensing decoding constraint (cardinality constraint).\nThese two constraints make the problem of maximizing network lifetime via\nsensor node activation and compressive sensing NP-hard. To overcome this\ndifficulty, an alternative approach that iteratively solves energy balancing\nproblems is proposed. However, understanding whether maximizing network\nlifetime and energy balancing problems are aligned objectives is a fundamental\nopen issue. The analysis reveals that the two optimization problems give\ndifferent solutions, but the difference between the lifetime achieved by the\nenergy balancing approach and the maximum lifetime is small when the initial\nenergy at sensor nodes is significantly larger than the energy consumed for a\nsingle transmission. The lifetime achieved by the energy balancing is\nasymptotically optimal, and that the achievable network lifetime is at least\n$50$\\% of the optimum.

Two relevant\nspectral parameters viz. the average center shift, <CS>, and the relative\nrecoil-free fraction, f/fo, were explored. The former yielded the Debye\ntemperature, T_D1, and the mean-square velocity of vibration, <v^2>, while the\nlatter T_D2 and the mean-square amplitude of vibrations, <x^2>. Significant\ndifferences in the lattice-dynamical behaviors in the magnetic and paramagnetic\nphases were revealed. In particular, the values of T_D were notably lower and\nthose of f/fo greatly higher in the former. This anomalous result has likely\nits origin in a remarkably high inharmonic contribution to the vibrations found\nfor the ground magnetic state (spin-glass). Especially anomalous behavior vs.\ntemperature exhibits <x^2> where four well defined ranges could have been\nidentified and ascribed to the paramagnetic, ferromagnetic and two spin-glass\nphases.

However, there is no clear\nunderstanding of such neural computational models. In this paper, we try to\nunravel \"black-box\" structure of Ann model from network flow. Specifically, we\nconsider the feed forward Ann as a network flow model, which consists of many\ndirectional class-pathways. Each class-pathway encodes one class. The\nclass-pathway of a class is obtained by connecting the activated neural nodes\nin each layer from input to output, where activation value of neural node\n(node-value) is defined by the weights of each layer in a trained\nANN-classifier. From the perspective of the class-pathway, training an\nANN-classifier can be regarded as the formulation process of class-pathways of\ndifferent classes. By analyzing the the distances of each two class-pathways in\na trained ANN-classifiers, we try to answer the questions, why the classifier\nperforms so? At last, from the neural encodes view, we define the importance of\neach neural node through the class-pathways, which is helpful to optimize the\nstructure of a classifier. Experiments for two types of ANN model including\nmulti-layer MLP and CNN verify that the network flow based on class-pathway is\na reasonable explanation for ANN models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2017 11:45:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-27"}

The obtained data contain multiple frequency components\nwhich are interpreted by considering all possible angles for the Brillouin\nscattering of light achieved through the multiplexing of the propagation\ndirections of light and coherent sound by the metallic grating. The emitted\nacoustic field can be equivalently presented as a superposition of the plane\ninhomogeneous acoustic waves, which constitute an acoustic diffraction grating\nfor the probe light. Thus, the obtained results can also be interpreted as a\nconsequence of probe light diffraction by both metallic and acoustic gratings.\nThe realized scheme of time-domain Brillouin scattering with metallic grating\noperating in reflection mode provides access to acoustic frequencies from the\nminimal to the maximal possible in a single experimental configuration for the\ndirections of probe light incidence and scattered light detection. This is\nachieved by monitoring of the backward and forward Brillouin scattering\nprocesses in parallel.

The purely dynamical aspects of this departure from radial symmetry\nare well understood. However, the observed dust is subject to additional forces\nand effects, most notably collisions and drag. Aims: To complement the studies\nof dynamics, we therefore aim to understand how new asymmetries are created by\nthe addition of collisional evolution and drag forces, and existing ones\nstrengthened or overridden. Methods: We augmented our existing numerical code\n\"Analysis of Collisional Evolution\" (ACE) by an azimuthal dimension, the\nlongitude of periapse. A set of fiducial discs with global eccentricities\nranging from 0 to 0.4 is evolved over giga-year timescales. Size distribution\nand spatial variation of dust are analysed and interpreted. The basic impact of\nbelt eccentricity on spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and images is\ndiscussed.\n  Results: We find features imposed on characteristic timescales. First,\nradiation pressure defines size cutoffs that differ between periapse and\napoapse, resulting in an asymmetric halo. The differences in size distribution\nmake the observable asymmetry of the halo depend on wavelength. Second,\ncollisional equilibrium prefers smaller grains on the apastron side of the\nparent belt, reducing the effect of pericentre glow and the overall asymmetry.\nThird, Poynting-Robertson drag fills the region interior to an eccentric belt\nsuch that the apastron side is more tenuous. Interpretation and prediction of\nthe appearance in scattered light is problematic when spatial and size\ndistribution are coupled.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2017 12:58:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-30"}

In astronomy, for example,\none can dramatically improve estimates of the parameters that dictate the\nevolution of the Universe by working with full conditional densities instead of\nregression (i.e., conditional mean) estimates. More generally, standard\nregression falls short in any prediction problem where the distribution of the\nresponse is more complex with multi-modality, asymmetry or heteroscedastic\nnoise.

Reducing $\\alpha$ and $H/R$ increases the gap size and\n$T_\\mathrm{prec}$ reaches 2500 $T_\\mathrm{bin}$. For varying binary mass ratios\n$q_\\mathrm{bin}$ the gap size remains constant whereas $T_\\mathrm{prec}$\ndecreases for increasing $q_\\mathrm{bin}$.\n  For varying binary eccentricities $e_\\mathrm{bin}$ we find two separate\nbranches in the gap size and eccentricity diagram. The bifurcation occurs at\naround $e_\\mathrm{crit} \\approx 0.18$ where the gap is smallest with the\nshortest $T_\\mathrm{prec}$. For $e_\\mathrm{bin}$ smaller and larger than\n$e_\\mathrm{crit}$ the gap size and $T_\\mathrm{prec}$ increase. Circular\nbinaries create the most eccentric disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2017 14:07:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2018 13:32:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-14"}

This paper gives four 5G mmWave deployment examples and describes in\nchronological order the scenarios and use cases of their probable deployment,\nincluding expected system architectures and hardware prototypes. The paper\nstarts with 28 GHz outdoor backhauling for fixed wireless access and moving\nhotspots, which will be demonstrated at the PyeongChang winter Olympic games in\n2018. The second deployment example is a 60 GHz unlicensed indoor access system\nat the Tokyo-Narita airport, which is combined with Mobile Edge Computing (MEC)\nto enable ultra-high speed content download with low latency. The third example\nis mmWave mesh network to be used as a micro Radio Access Network ({\\mu}-RAN),\nfor cost-effective backhauling of small-cell Base Stations (BSs) in dense urban\nscenarios. The last example is mmWave based Vehicular-to-Vehicular (V2V) and\nVehicular-to-Everything (V2X) communications system, which enables automated\ndriving by exchanging High Definition (HD) dynamic map information between cars\nand Roadside Units (RSUs). For 5G and beyond, mmWave and MEC will play\nimportant roles for a diverse set of applications that require both ultra-high\ndata rate and low latency communications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2017 14:15:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-27"}

The procedure is implemented in the open-source Python program\ndetCI@ORBKIT, which extends the capabilities of our recently published\npost-processing toolbox [J. Comput. Chem. 37 (2016) 1511].

However, the phase-difference brings large noise due to its low\nsensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Beside, special phase shifts are\nrequired in Xu's method. In the light of these problems, an extended\ndepth-range dual-wavelength phase-shifting interferometry is proposed. Firstly,\nthe least squares algorithm is utilized to retrieve the single-wavelength phase\nfrom a sequence of N-frame simultaneous phase-shifting dual-wavelength\ninterferograms (SPSDWI) with random phase shifts. Then the phase-difference and\nphase-sum are calculated from the wrapped phases of single wavelength, and the\niterative two-step temporal phase-unwrapping is introduced to unwrap the\nphase-sum, which can extend the depth-range and improve the sensitivity.\nFinally, the height of objects is achieved.

Most of the\nliterature on this topic is based on what we call the \"Fixed-X\" assumption,\nwhere covariate values are assumed to be nonrandom. By contrast, it is often\nmore reasonable to take a \"Random-X\" view, where the covariate values are\nindependently drawn for both training and prediction. To study the\napplicability of covariance penalties in this setting, we propose a\ndecomposition of Random-X prediction error in which the randomness in the\ncovariates contributes to both the bias and variance components. This\ndecomposition is general, but we concentrate on the fundamental case of least\nsquares regression. We prove that in this setting the move from Fixed-X to\nRandom-X prediction results in an increase in both bias and variance. When the\ncovariates are normally distributed and the linear model is unbiased, all terms\nin this decomposition are explicitly computable, which yields an extension of\nMallows' Cp that we call $RCp$. $RCp$ also holds asymptotically for certain\nclasses of nonnormal covariates. When the noise variance is unknown, plugging\nin the usual unbiased estimate leads to an approach that we call $\\hat{RCp}$,\nwhich is closely related to Sp (Tukey 1967), and GCV (Craven and Wahba 1978).\nFor excess bias, we propose an estimate based on the \"shortcut-formula\" for\nordinary cross-validation (OCV), resulting in an approach we call $RCp^+$.\nTheoretical arguments and numerical simulations suggest that $RCP^+$ is\ntypically superior to OCV, though the difference is small. We further examine\nthe Random-X error of other popular estimators. The surprising result we get\nfor ridge regression is that, in the heavily-regularized regime, Random-X\nvariance is smaller than Fixed-X variance, which can lead to smaller overall\nRandom-X error.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2017 15:22:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Jun 2017 19:16:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-13"}

For the used pinning\ngeometries and the used parameters, the unexpected behavior is reported that\nthe energy barrier to overcome the pinning site is larger than the energy\nbarrier of the annihilation of a skyrmion. The annihilation takes place at\nboundaries by current driven motion as well as due to the excitation over\nenergy barriers, in the absence of currents, without forming Bloch points. It\nis reported that the pinning sites, which are required to allow thermally\nstable bits, significantly increase the critical current densities to move the\nbits in skyrmion like structures to about $j_{crit}$ = 0.62 TA/m$^2$. These\ncurrents are similar to those obtained experimentally to move stable skyrmions\nat room temperature.

The calculation of a thermodynamic\nproperty for a system whose molecules are described by such a FF involves the\ncalculation of the residual property prior to its addition to the corresponding\nideal-gas (IG) property, the latter of which is separately calculated, either\nusing thermochemical compilations or nowadays accurate quantum mechanical\ncalculations. Although the simulation of a volumetric residual property\nproceeds by simply replacing the intermolecular FF in the rigid molecule case\nby the total (intramolecular plus intermolecular) FF, this is not the case for\na caloric property. We discuss the methodology required in performing such\ncalculations, and focus on the example of the molar heat capacity at constant\npressure, $c_P$, one of the most important caloric properties. We also consider\nthree approximations for the calculation procedure, and illustrate their\nconsequences for the examples of the relatively simple molecule 2-propanol,\n${\\rm CH_3CH(OH)CH_3}$, and for monoethanolamine, ${\\rm HO(CH_2)_2NH_2}$, an\nimportant fluid used in carbon capture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2017 21:35:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-15"}

In this work, we introduce a new method based on\natomistic dynamics of lattice coupled with a concurrent atomistic-continuum\nmethod to enable a full phonon representation in the continuum description.\nThis then permits the passage of short-wavelength, high-frequency phonon waves\nfrom the atomistic to continuum regions.
