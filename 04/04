Unfortunately, previous work on\nmultiuser MIMO has shown that the codebook size for channel feedback should\nscale exponentially with the number of base station (BS) antennas, which is\ngreatly increased in massive MIMO systems. To reduce the codebook size and\nfeedback overhead, we propose an angle-of-departure (AoD)-adaptive subspace\ncodebook for channel feedback in FDD massive MIMO systems. Our key insight is\nto leverage the observation that path AoDs vary more slowly than the path\ngains. Within the angle coherence time, by utilizing the constant AoD\ninformation, the proposed AoD-adaptive subspace codebook is able to quantize\nthe channel vector in a more accurate way. We also provide performance analysis\nof the proposed codebook in the large-dimensional regime, where we prove that\nto limit the capacity degradation within an acceptable level, the required\nnumber of feedback bits only scales linearly with the number of resolvable\n(path) AoDs, which is much smaller than the number of BS antennas. Moreover, we\ncompare quantized channel feedback using the proposed AoD-adaptive subspace\ncodebook with analog channel feedback. Extensive simulations that verify the\nanalytical results are provided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2017 16:08:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-26"}

The remarkable feature of this\nnonmagnetic, inversion-symmetry-breaking material is that it consists of only\nsimple $s$- and $p$-block elements. Interestingly, the material is ordinary\ninsulator in the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and becomes nodal-surface\ntopological semimetal showing drumhead states when SOC is included. This is in\nstark contrast to other nodal-line and nodal-surface semimetals, where the\nextended nodal structure is destroyed once SOC is included. Importantly, the\nlinear band crossings host three-, four-, five- and six-fold degeneracies near\nthe Fermi level, making this compound very attractive for the study of\n`unconventional' fermions. The band crossing points form a three-dimensional\nnodal structure around the zone center at the Fermi level. We identify the\nsurface states responsible for the appearance of the drumhead states. The alloy\nalso shows a phase transition from topological semimetal to a trivial insulator\non application of pressure. In addition to revealing an intriguing effect of\nSOC on the nodal structure, our findings introduce a new half-Heusler alloy in\nthe family of topological semimetals, thus creating more avenues for\nexperimental exploration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2017 17:25:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-04"}

Instead, we propose that feedback from young stars can\ndisrupt clouds before the global collapse of the shear-limited area is\ncompleted. We develop a shear-feedback hybrid model that depends on three\nobservable quantities: the gas surface density, the epicylic frequency, and the\nToomre parameter. The model is tested in four galactic environments: the Milky\nWay, the Local Group galaxy M31, the spiral galaxy M83, and the high-redshift\ngalaxy zC406690.

In zC406690, the\nmaximum cluster masses decrease further due to their inspiral by dynamical\nfriction.

One possible\ninstance in which this may occur is if the neutron star undergoes a glitch, a\nsudden rapid increase in the rotation frequency seen in the timing of many\nradio pulsars.

We find that for many previous and\npotential future searches continuous-wave signals have an elevated probability\nof undergoing one or more glitches and that these glitches will often lead to a\nsubstantial fraction of the signal-to-noise ratio being lost.

Detecting, identifying and understand- ing the first galaxies and\nBHs is one of the current observational and theoretical challenges in galaxy\nformation. In this paper we present a population synthesis model aimed at\ngalaxies, BHs and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) at high redshift. The model\nbuilds a population based on empirical relations. Galaxies are characterized by\na spectral energy distribution determined by age and metallicity, and AGNs by a\nspectral energy distribution determined by BH mass and accretion rate.

Most\nunsupervised action proposal methods tend to generate hundreds of action\nproposals which include many noisy, inconsistent, and unranked action\nproposals, while supervised action proposal methods take advantage of\npredefined object detectors (e.g., human detector) to refine and score the\naction proposals, but they require thousands of manual annotations to train.\n  Given the action proposals in a video, the goal of the proposed work is to\ngenerate a few better action proposals that are ranked properly. In our\napproach, we first divide action proposal into sub-proposal and then use\nDynamic Programming based graph optimization scheme to select the optimal\ncombinations of sub-proposals from different proposals and assign each new\nproposal a score. We propose a new unsupervised image-based actioness detector\nthat leverages web images and employs it as one of the node scores in our graph\nformulation.

In\nthis paper, we leverage visual and textual modalities for image search by\nlearning their correlation with input query.

Synchronization\nerrors are strictly more general and much harder to deal with than commonly\nconsidered half-errors, i.e., symbol corruptions and erasures. For every\n$\\epsilon >0$, synchronization strings allow to index a sequence with an\n$\\epsilon^{-O(1)}$ size alphabet such that one can efficiently transform $k$\nsynchronization errors into $(1+\\epsilon)k$ half-errors. This powerful new\ntechnique has many applications. In this paper, we focus on designing insdel\ncodes, i.e., error correcting block codes (ECCs) for insertion deletion\nchannels.\n  While ECCs for both half-errors and synchronization errors have been\nintensely studied, the later has largely resisted progress. Indeed, it took\nuntil 1999 for the first insdel codes with constant rate, constant distance,\nand constant alphabet size to be constructed by Schulman and Zuckerman. Insdel\ncodes for asymptotically large or small noise rates were given in 2016 by\nGuruswami et al. but these codes are still polynomially far from the optimal\nrate-distance tradeoff. This makes the understanding of insdel codes up to this\nwork equivalent to what was known for regular ECCs after Forney introduced\nconcatenated codes in his doctoral thesis 50 years ago.\n  A direct application of our synchronization strings based indexing method\ngives a simple black-box construction which transforms any ECC into an equally\nefficient insdel code with a slightly larger alphabet size. This instantly\ntransfers much of the highly developed understanding for regular ECCs over\nlarge constant alphabets into the realm of insdel codes. Most notably, we\nobtain efficient insdel codes which get arbitrarily close to the optimal\nrate-distance tradeoff given by the Singleton bound for the complete noise\nspectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2017 20:56:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

The parameter space\nthat results in division by zero in previous treatments is explicitly defined\nand accommodated in the solution. Polynomial roots required for the solution\nare expressed in terms of a single real root obtained using simple functional\nforms. A simple graphical rendition of this root is developed that clarifies\nand characterizes its dependence on the physical parameters of the problem. As\na result, the explicit time dependence of the system as a function of its\nphysical parameters is immediately evident. Several intuitive models of system\ndynamics are also developed. In particular, the Bloch equation is separable in\nthe proper coordinate system, written as the sum of a relaxation operator and\neither a null operator or a commuting rotation.

Current approaches can be broadly divided\ninto those that compare two images taken at similar periods of the year and\nthose that monitor changes by using multiple images taken during the growing\nseason. The CMFDA algorithm described in Zhu et al. (2012) is an algorithm that\nbuilds on the latter category by implementing a year-long, continuous,\ntime-series based approach to monitoring images. This algorithm was developed\nfor 30m resolution, 16-day frequency reflectance data from the Landsat\nsatellite. In this work we adapt the algorithm to 1km, 16-day frequency\nreflectance data from the modis sensor aboard the Terra satellite. The CMFDA\nalgorithm is composed of two submodels which are fitted on a pixel-by-pixel\nbasis. The first estimates the amount of surface reflectance as a function of\nthe day of the year. The second estimates the occurrence of a deforestation\nevent by comparing the last few predicted and real reflectance values. For this\ncomparison, the reflectance observations for six different bands are first\ncombined into a forest index. Real and predicted values of the forest index are\nthen compared and high absolute differences for consecutive observation dates\nare flagged as deforestation events. Our adapted algorithm also uses the two\nmodel framework. However, since the modis 13A2 dataset used, includes\nreflectance data for different spectral bands than those included in the\nLandsat dataset, we cannot construct the forest index.

However, the resource inelasticity problem faced by the SCs due to\ntheir relatively scarce resources (e.g., virtual machines) might lead to a\npotential degradation of customer QoS and loss of revenue. A proposed solution\nto this problem recommends the sharing of resources between competing SCs to\nalleviate the resource inelasticity issues that might arise [1]. Based on this\nidea, a recent effort ([2]) proposed SC-Share, a performance-driven static\nmarket model for competitive small cloud environments that results in an\nefficient market equilibrium jointly optimizing customer QoS satisfaction and\nSC revenue generation. However, an important non-obvious question still remains\nto be answered, without which SC sharing markets may not be guaranteed to\nsustain in the long-run - is it still possible to achieve a stable market\nefficient state when the supply of SC resources is dynamic in nature and there\nis a variation of customer demand over time?

Its main application is slicing\nlarge trading orders, in the interest of minimizing trading costs and potential\nperturbations of price dynamics due to liquidity shocks. The initial\noptimization frameworks were based on mean-variance minimization for the\ntrading costs. In the past 15 years, finer modelling of price dynamics, more\nrealistic control variables and different cost functionals were developed. The\ninclusion of signals (i.e. short term predictors of price dynamics) in optimal\ntrading is a recent development and it is also the subject of this work.\n  We incorporate a Markovian signal in the optimal trading framework which was\ninitially proposed by Gatheral, Schied, and Slynko [21] and provide results on\nthe existence and uniqueness of an optimal trading strategy. Moreover, we\nderive an explicit singular optimal strategy for the special case of an\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck signal and an exponentially decaying transient market\nimpact. The combination of a mean-reverting signal along with a market impact\ndecay is of special interest, since they affect the short term price variations\nin opposite directions.\n  Later, we show that in the asymptotic limit were the transient market impact\nbecomes instantaneous, the optimal strategy becomes continuous. This result is\ncompatible with the optimal trading framework which was proposed by Cartea and\nJaimungal [10].\n  In order to support our models, we analyse nine months of tick by tick data\non 13 European stocks from the NASDAQ OMX exchange.

However, calculating (and even approximating) the spectral gaps of\npractical Monte Carlo Markov chains in statistics has proven to be an extremely\ndifficult and often insurmountable task, especially when these chains move on\ncontinuous state spaces. In this paper, a method for accurate estimation of the\nspectral gap is developed for general state space Markov chains whose operators\nare non-negative and trace-class. The method is based on the fact that the\nsecond largest eigenvalue (and hence the spectral gap) of such operators can be\nbounded above and below by simple functions of the power sums of the\neigenvalues. These power sums often have nice integral representations. A\nclassical Monte Carlo method is proposed to estimate these integrals, and a\nsimple sufficient condition for finite variance is provided. This leads to\nasymptotically valid confidence intervals for the second largest eigenvalue\n(and the spectral gap) of the Markov operator. In contrast with previously\nexisting techniques, our method is not based on a near-stationary version of\nthe Markov chain, which, paradoxically, cannot be obtained in a principled\nmanner without bounds on the spectral gap. On the other hand, it can be quite\nexpensive from a computational standpoint.

However, a semidetached configuration with the less-mass component\nfilling and the primary nearly filling each of their Roche lobes was derived\nfrom the synthesis of the light and radial velocity curves by using the 2015\nversion of the Wilson-Devinney code. We consider the period decrease to be the\nnonconservative mass transfer from the secondary component to the primary and\nthe mass loss of the system, which was thought to be an EB type while it should\nbe an EA type (semi-detached Algol-type) from our study. The masses, radii and\nluminosities of the primary and secondary are $1.60\\pm0.07 M_\\odot$,\n$1.64\\pm0.02 R_\\odot$, $14.14\\pm0.73 L_\\odot$ and $0.74\\pm0.02 M_\\odot$,\n$1.23\\pm0.02 R_\\odot$, $1.65\\pm0.05 L_\\odot$, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2017 02:04:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-24"}

The approach begins with the models in RE stage and provides\nruntime support for self-adaptation. We capture adaptation mechanisms as\ngraphical elements in the goal model. By assigning reliability and performance\nattributes to related system tasks, we derive the tagged sequential diagram for\nspecifying the reliability and performances of system behaviors. To formalize\nsystem behavior, we transform the requirements model to the corresponding\nbehavior model, expressed by Label Transition Systems (LTS). To analyze the\nreliability requirements and performance requirements, we merged the sequential\ndiagram and LTS to a variable Discrete-Time Markov Chains (DTMC) and a variable\nContinuous-Time Markov Chains (CTMC) respectively. Adaptation candidates are\ncharacterized by the variable states. The optimal decision is derived by\nverifying the concerned NFRs and reducing the decision space.

In\nthis work, we calculated Li intercalation-site energetics across cathode\ninterfaces and demonstrated the physics governing these energetics on both\nsides of the interface. We studied the olivine/olivine-structured\nLixFePO4/LixMPO4 (x=0 and 1, M=Co, Ti, Mn) and layered/layered-structured\nLiNiO2/TiO2 interfaces to explore different material structures and transition\nmetal elements. We found that across an interface from a high- to low-voltage\nmaterial the Li voltage remains constant in the high-voltage material and\ndecays approximately linearly in the low-voltage region, approaching the Li\nvoltage of the low-voltage material. This effect ranges from 0.5-9nm depending\non the interfacial dipole screening. This effect provides a mechanism for a\nhigh-voltage material at an interface to significantly enhance the Li\nintercalation voltage in a low-voltage material over nanometer scale. We showed\nthat this voltage enhancement is governed by a combination of electron transfer\n(from low- to high-voltage regions), strain and interfacial dipole screening.\nWe explored the implications of this voltage enhancement for a novel\nheterostructured-cathode design and redox pseudocapacitors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2017 04:40:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

Due to the\ninherent volatility of the open and changeable environment in which SAS is\nembedded, the ability of adaptation is highly demanded by many\nsoftware-intensive systems. Two concerns, i.e., the requirements uncertainty\nand the context uncertainty are most important among others at Requirements\nEngineering (RE) stage. However, requirements analyzers can hardly figure out\nthe mathematical relation between requirements, system behavior and context,\nespecially for complex and nonlinear systems, due to the existence of above\nuncertainties, misunderstanding and ambiguity of prior knowledge. An essential\nissue to be addressed is how to model and specify these uncertainties at RE\nstage and how to utilize the prior knowledge to achieve adaptation. In this\npaper, we propose a fuzzy-based approach to modeling uncertainty and achieving\nevolution. The approach introduces specifications to describe fuzziness. Based\non the specifications, we derive a series of reasoning rules as knowledge base\nfor achieving adaptation and evolution. These two targets are implemented\nthrough four reasoning schemas from a control theory perspective. Specifically,\nforward reasoning schema is used for direct adaptation; backward reasoning\nschema is used for optimal adaptation. Parameter-identified schema implements\nlearning evolution by considering SAS as the gray-box system, while\nsystem-identified reasoning schema implements learning evolution by considering\nSAS as the gray-box system. The former two schemas function as the control\ngroup, while the latter two are de-signed as the experimental groups to\nillustrate the learning ability. Our approach is implemented under three types\nof context through the demonstration of a mobile computing application.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2017 04:53:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

A key\ncontribution of the paper is to present a rigorous stability analysis showing\nthat the attitude estimates of the observer converge exponentially to the true\nattitude and to provide a lower bound for the convergence rate of the observer.\nThrough experimental studies, we demonstrate that the observer effectively\ncompensates for the inherent drift of the pure monocular vision based attitude\nestimation and is able to recover the North-East-Down orientation even if it is\ninitialized with a very large attitude error.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2017 06:29:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

Since operating the telescopes only during dark time would severely\nlimit the duty cycle, observations are also performed when the Moon is present\nin the sky. Here we develop a dedicated Moon-adapted analysis to characterize\nthe performance of MAGIC under moonlight. We evaluate energy threshold, angular\nresolution and sensitivity of MAGIC under different background light levels,\nbased on Crab Nebula observations and tuned Monte Carlo simulations. This study\nincludes observations taken under non-standard hardware configurations, such as\nreducing the camera photomultiplier tubes gain by a factor ~1.7 (Reduced HV\nsettings) with respect to standard settings (Nominal HV) or using UV-pass\nfilters to strongly reduce the amount of moonlight reaching the cameras of the\ntelescopes. The Crab Nebula spectrum is correctly reconstructed in all the\nstudied illumination levels, that reach up to 30 times brighter than under dark\nconditions. The main effect of moonlight is an increase in the analysis energy\nthreshold and in the systematic uncertainties on the flux normalization. The\nsensitivity degradation is constrained to be below 10%, within 15-30% and\nbetween 60 and 80% for Nominal HV, Reduced HV and UV-pass filter observations,\nrespectively. No worsening of the angular resolution was found. Thanks to\nobservations during moonlight, the maximal duty cycle of MAGIC can be increased\nfrom ~18%, under dark nights only, to up to ~40% in total with only moderate\nperformance degradation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2017 07:48:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2017 08:13:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 1 Aug 2017 13:00:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 2 Aug 2017 09:34:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-27"}

We have considered the results at $z=0,0.5,1$, and we\nhave analysed power spectrum in real and redshift space, object-by-object\ndifference in position and velocity, density Probability Distribution Function\n(PDF) and its moments, phase difference of Fourier modes. We find that higher\nLPT orders are generally able to better reproduce the clustering of halos,\nwhile little or no improvement is found for the matter density field when going\nto 2LPT and 3LPT. Augmentation provides some improvement when coupled with\n2LPT, while its effect is limited when coupled with 3LPT. Little improvement is\nbrought by MUSCLE with respect to Augmentation.

We also show that local\nion-ion repulsion accounts for a splitting of Ca$^{2+}$ profiles observed\nearlier in Brownian dynamics simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2017 11:13:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Apr 2017 16:31:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2017 15:28:35 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2017 17:41:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-31"}

They demonstrate\ncharacteristic scaling laws in dependence on the principal quantum number $n$\nfor features such as the magnetic field for level crossing. While bearing\nstriking similarities to Rydberg atoms, fundamentally new insights may be\nobtained for Rydberg excitons, as the crystal environment gives easy optical\naccess to many states within an exciton multiplet. Here we study experimentally\nand theoretically the scaling of several characteristic parameters of Rydberg\nexcitons with $n$. From absorption spectra in magnetic field we find for the\nfirst crossing of levels with adjacent principal quantum numbers a $B_r \\propto\nn^{-4}$ dependence of the resonance field strength, $B_r$, due to the dominant\nparamagnetic term unlike in the atomic case where the diamagnetic contribution\nis decisive. By contrast, in electric field we find scaling laws just like for\nRydberg atoms. The resonance electric field strength scales as $E_r \\propto\nn^{-5}$. We observe anticrossings of the states belonging to multiplets with\ndifferent principal quantum numbers. The energy splittings at the avoided\ncrossings scale as $n^{-4}$ which we relate to the crystal specific deviation\nof the exciton Hamiltonian from the hydrogen model. We observe the exciton\npolarizability in the electric field to scale as $n^7$. In magnetic field the\ncrossover field strength from a hydrogen-like exciton to a magnetoexciton\ndominated by electron and hole Landau level quantization scales as $n^{-3}$.\nThe ionization voltages demonstrate a $n^{-4}$ scaling as for atoms. The width\nof the absorption lines remains constant before dissociation for high enough\n$n$, while for small $n \\lesssim 12$ an exponential increase with the field is\nfound.

TiO2 nanopowder is one of the well-known synthetic\nmaterials in the modern nanotechnology field. It has many interesting,\nlucrative and salient properties. These characters are attracting the\nresearchers towards to exploit this material in variety of applications from\nenergy to environmental. It is a highly sensitive and excellent photo-catalyst\nmaterial. So, it can be used in gas sensors, in water splitting to generate\nhydrogen, and in waste water treatment to degrade the organic pollutants. It is\nsoluble in ethanol, ethylene glycol and chloroform. TiO2 nanopowder is prepared\nby many methods such as sol-gel method, chemical vapour deposition,\nhydro-thermal, micro-emulsion etc. However, low cost and large scale synthesis\nof nanoparticles for commercial applications are the major challenges in the\npresent day scenario. Mechanical milling is a simple method to prepare\nnanopowder where milling time plays very important role. The milling time may\nvary from 0 to 60 hour. The crystallinity, phase, size, shape and surface\nfeatures are some of the factors affected by the milling process. For the\npreparation of TiO2 nanomaterial, the mechanical milling is more advantageous\nthan other methods. It is a low cost, non toxic method which offers high\nchemical stability.

We present a\nmodification of this sum by adding two types of terms to it. The first type\nadds linear combinations of \"shifted\" Green functions, ensuring that the\nspatial singularities introduced by these terms are located below the grating\nand therefore outside of the physical domain.

The Higgs bosons are produced dominantly at the Large\nHadron Collider (LHC) via gluon fusion through top quark loop, while one of the\nsubdominant ones takes place through bottom quark annihilation whose\ncontribution is equally important and must be included in precision studies.\nHere, we have computed analytically the inclusive cross section of the Higgs\nboson produced through this channel under the soft-virtual (SV) approximation\nat N$^{3}$LO QCD following an elegant formalism. Moreover, the differential\nrapidity distribution is another most important observable, which is expected\nto be measured in upcoming days at the LHC. This immediately calls for very\nprecise theoretical predictions. The analytical expressions of the SV\ncorrections to this observable at N$^{3}$LO for the Higgs boson, produced\nthrough gluon fusion, and leptonic pair in Drell-Yan (DY) production are\ncomputed and the numerical impacts of these results are demonstrated.

While this method is\nsimple and provides great results, it is not able to reconstruct (partially)\noccluded surfaces and requires a large number frames to filter out sensor noise\nand outliers. Motivated by the availability of large 3D model repositories and\nrecent advances in deep learning, we present a novel 3D CNN architecture that\nlearns to predict an implicit surface representation from the input depth maps.\nOur learning based method significantly outperforms the traditional volumetric\nfusion approach in terms of noise reduction and outlier suppression. By\nlearning the structure of real world 3D objects and scenes, our approach is\nfurther able to reconstruct occluded regions and to fill in gaps in the\nreconstruction.

Inertial-measurement unit (IMU) is promising to determine the\nchange of position over short periods of time, but it is very sensitive to\nerror accumulation over long term run. By equipping the mobile users with\nranging unit, e.g. ultra-wideband (UWB), it is possible to achieve accurate\nrelative positioning by trilateration-based approaches. As compared to vision\nor laser-based sensors, the UWB does not need to be with in line-of-sight and\nprovides accurate distance estimation. However, UWB does not provide any\nbearing information and the communication range is limited, thus UWB alone\ncannot determine the user location without any ambiguity.

The\nbasic goal is to learn a sparse representation from an overcomplete basis set.\nDue to combining the advantages of generic multiscale representations with\nlearning based adaptivity, multiscale dictionary representation approaches have\nthe power in capturing structural characteristics of natural images. However,\nexisting multiscale learning approaches still suffer from three main\nweaknesses: inadaptability to diverse scales of image data, sensitivity to\nnoise and outliers, difficulty to determine optimal dictionary structure. In\nthis paper, we present a novel multiscale dictionary learning paradigm for\nsparse image representations based on an improved empirical mode decomposition.\nThis powerful data-driven analysis tool for multi-dimensional signal can fully\nadaptively decompose the image into multiscale oscillating components according\nto intrinsic modes of data self. This treatment can obtain a robust and\neffective sparse representation, and meanwhile generates a raw base dictionary\nat multiple geometric scales and spatial frequency bands. This dictionary is\nrefined by selecting optimal oscillating atoms based on frequency clustering.\nIn order to further enhance sparsity and generalization, a tolerance dictionary\nis learned using a coherence regularized model. A fast proximal scheme is\ndeveloped to optimize this model. The multiscale dictionary is considered as\nthe product of oscillating dictionary and tolerance dictionary. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that the proposed learning approach has the superior\nperformance in sparse image representations as compared with several competing\nmethods.
