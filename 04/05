Most approaches recover the depth at each pixel based on the\nfocal setting which exhibits maximal sharpness. Yet, it is not obvious how to\nreliably estimate the sharpness level, particularly in low-textured areas. In\nthis paper, we propose `Deep Depth From Focus (DDFF)' as the first end-to-end\nlearning approach to this problem. One of the main challenges we face is the\nhunger for data of deep neural networks. In order to obtain a significant\namount of focal stacks with corresponding groundtruth depth, we propose to\nleverage a light-field camera with a co-calibrated RGB-D sensor. This allows us\nto digitally create focal stacks of varying sizes. Compared to existing\nbenchmarks our dataset is 25 times larger, enabling the use of machine learning\nfor this inverse problem. We compare our results with state-of-the-art DFF\nmethods and we also analyze the effect of several key deep architectural\ncomponents.

We used medium-resolution optical\nspectroscopy to assess the objects' accretion status and to measure the Halpha\nline.

We find a significant correlation\nbetween stellar mass and the full width at 10 per cent of the peak (W10%) of\nthe Halpha line that does not seem to be related to variations in free-fall\nvelocity. Finally, our data reveal a positive correlation between the Halpha\nequivalent width and its W10%, indicative of a systematic modulation in the\nline profile whereby the high-velocity wings of the line are proportionally\nmore enhanced than its core when the line luminosity increases.

The correct interpretation of\nthe 5-dimensional charges in terms of the string-theory objects solves the\nnon-Abelian hair puzzle, allowing for the microscopic accounting of the\nentropy. We discuss the validity of the solution when alpha prime corrections\nare taken into account.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2017 18:04:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2017 17:57:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 14 Dec 2017 22:51:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-17"}

Mufasa reproduces the\nobserved present-day red sequence reasonably well, including its slope,\namplitude, and scatter. In Mufasa, the red sequence slope is driven entirely by\nthe steep stellar mass-stellar metallicity relation, which independently agrees\nwith observations. High-mass star-forming galaxies blend smoothly onto the red\nsequence, indicating the lack of a well-defined green valley at M*>10^10.5 Mo.\nThe most massive galaxies quench the earliest and then grow very little in mass\nvia dry merging; they attain their high masses at earlier epochs when cold\ninflows more effectively penetrate hot halos. To higher redshifts, the red\nsequence becomes increasingly contaminated with massive dusty star-forming\ngalaxies; UVJ selection subtly but effectively separates these populations. We\nthen examine the evolution of the mass functions of central and satellite\ngalaxies split into passive and star-forming via UVJ. Massive quenched systems\nshow good agreement with observations out to z~2, despite not including a rapid\nearly quenching mode associated with mergers. However, low-mass quenched\ngalaxies are far too numerous at z<1 in Mufasa, indicating that Mufasa strongly\nover-quenches satellites.

Complementary to these\napproaches, DyVEDeep is a dynamic approach that exploits the heterogeneity in\nthe inputs to DNNs to improve their compute efficiency with comparable\nclassification accuracy. DyVEDeep equips DNNs with dynamic effort mechanisms\nthat, in the course of processing an input, identify how critical a group of\ncomputations are to classify the input. DyVEDeep dynamically focuses its\ncompute effort only on the critical computa- tions, while skipping or\napproximating the rest.

Thus\nfar, the mechanism for the compositional stratification and seismic\ninhomogeneity, especially their relationship with the speciation of iron in the\nlower mantle, remains poorly understood. We have built a complete and\nintegrated thermodynamic model of iron and aluminum chemistry for lower mantle\nconditions, and from this model has emerged a stratified picture of the\nvalence, spin and composition profile in the lower mantle. Within this picture\nthe lower mantle has an upper region with Fe3+ enriched bridgmanite with\nhigh-spin ferropericlase and metallic Fe, and a lower region with low-spin,\niron-enriched ferropericlase coexisting with iron-depleted bridgmanite and\nalmost no metallic Fe. The transition between the regions occurs at a depth of\naround 1600km and is driven by the spin transition in ferropericlase, which\nsignificantly changes the iron partitioning and speciation to one that favors\nFe2+ in ferropericlase and suppresses Fe3+ and metallic iron formation These\nchanges lead to lowered bulk sound velocity by 3-4% around the mid-lower mantle\nand enhanced density by ~1% toward the lowermost mantle.

This is especially true for massive stars, which\nare important for the chemical enrichment of the universe. It is therefore\nimportant to constrain their physical parameters and internal angular momentum\ndistribution to calibrate stellar structure and evolution models. Stellar\ninternal rotation can be probed through asteroseismic studies of rotationally\nsplit oscillations but such results are still quite rare, especially for stars\nmore massive than the Sun. The SPB star HD201433 is known to be part of a\nsingle-lined spectroscopic triple system, with two low-mass companions orbiting\nwith periods of about 3.3 and 154 d.

The Kochen-Specker theorem rules out models of quantum theory that\nsatisfy a particular assumption of context-independence: that sharp\nmeasurements are assigned outcomes both deterministically and independently of\ntheir context. This notion of noncontextuality is not suited to a direct\nexperimental test because realistic measurements always have some degree of\nunsharpness due to noise. However, a generalized notion of noncontextuality has\nbeen proposed that is applicable to any experimental procedure, including\nunsharp measurements, but also preparations as well, and for which a quantum\nno-go result still holds. According to this notion, the model need only specify\na probability distribution over the outcomes of a measurement in a\ncontext-independent way, rather than specifying a particular outcome. It also\nimplies novel constraints of context-independence for the representation of\npreparations. In this article, we describe a general technique for translating\nproofs of the Kochen-Specker theorem into inequality constraints on realistic\nexperimental statistics, the violation of which witnesses the impossibility of\na noncontextual model. We focus on algebraic state-independent proofs, using\nthe Peres-Mermin square as our illustrative example. Our technique yields the\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for a particular set of correlations\n(between the preparations and the measurements) to admit a noncontextual model.\nThe inequalities thus derived are demonstrably robust to noise.

The clusters cover a mass range of\n14.2<log(M_200/M_odot)<15.2 and we measure spatially-resolved stellar\nkinematics for 315 member galaxies with stellar masses\n10.0<log(M_*/M_odot)<11.7 within 1R_200 of the cluster centers. We calculate\nthe spin parameter, lambda_R and use that to classify the kinematic morphology\nof the galaxies as fast or slow rotators. The total fraction of slow rotators\nin the early-type galaxy population, F_SR=0.14+/-0.02 and does not depend on\nhost cluster mass. Across the eight clusters, the fraction of slow rotators\nincreases with increasing local overdensity. We also find that the slow-rotator\nfraction increases at small clustercentric radii (R_cl<0.3R_200), and note that\nthere is also an increase in slow-rotator fraction at R_cl~0.6R_200. The slow\nrotators at these larger radii reside in cluster substructure. We find the\nstrongest increase in slow-rotator fraction occurs with increasing stellar\nmass. After accounting for the strong correlation with stellar mass, we find no\nsignificant relationship between spin parameter and local overdensity in the\ncluster environment. We conclude that the primary driver for the kinematic\nmorphology--density relationship in galaxy clusters is the changing\ndistribution of galaxy stellar mass with local environment. The presence of\nslow rotators in substructure suggests that the cluster kinematic\nmorphology--density relationship is a result of mass segregation of\nslow-rotating galaxies forming in groups that later merge with clusters and\nsink to the cluster center via dynamical friction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2017 20:07:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Jun 2017 22:05:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

The transaction costs associated with both trading and hedging are\nalso included.\n  To model the realistic dependence structure of the multivariate return\ndistributions, a new scenario generation method, employing a regular-vine\ncopula is developed. The use of vine copulas allows a better representation of\nthe characteristics of returns, specifically, their non-normality and\nasymmetric dependencies. It hence improves the representation of the\nuncertainty underlying decisions needed for international portfolio\noptimisation problems. Efficient portfolios optimised with scenarios generated\nfrom the new vine-copula method are compared with the portfolios from a\nstandard scenario generation method. Experimental results show that the\nproposed method, using realistic non-normal uncertainty, produces portfolios\nthat give better risk-return reward than those from a standard scenario\ngeneration approach, using normal distributions. The difference in risk-return\ncompensation is largest when the portfolios are constrained to require higher\nreturns.

More precisely, by\nprobabilistic well-posedness we mean that one endows the corresponding Sobolev\nspace of supercritical regularity with a non degenerate probability measure and\nthen one shows that almost surely with respect to this measure one can define a\n(unique) global flow. However, in most of the cases when the methods to prove\nprobabilistic well-posedness apply, there is no information about the measure\ntransported by the flow. Very recently, a method to prove that the transported\nmeasure is absolutely continuous with respect to the initial measure was\ndeveloped. In such a situation, we have a measure which is quasi-invariant\nunder the corresponding flow.\n  The aim of these lectures is to present all of the above described\ndevelopments in the context of the nonlinear wave equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2017 21:17:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2018 12:56:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-14"}

Methods exist to measure the GO\nsimilarity between two proteins in isolation, but pairs of proteins in a\nnetwork alignment are not isolated: each pairing is implicitly dependent upon\nevery other pairing via the alignment itself. Current methods fail to take into\naccount the frequency of GO terms across the networks, and attempt to account\nfor common GO terms in an ad hoc fashion by imposing arbitrary rules on when to\n\"allow\" GO terms based on their location in the GO hierarchy, rather than using\nreadily available frequency information in the PPI networks themselves. Here we\ndevelop a new measure, NetGO, that naturally weighs infrequent, informative GO\nterms more heavily than frequent, less informative GO terms, without requiring\narbitrary cutoffs. In particular, NetGO down-weights the score of frequent GO\nterms according to their frequency in the networks being aligned. This is a\nglobal measure applicable only to alignments, independent of pairwise GO\nmeasures, in the same sense that the edge-based EC or S3 scores are global\nmeasures of topological similarity independent of pairwise topological\nsimilarities. We demonstrate the superiority of NetGO by creating alignments of\npredetermined quality based on homologous pairs of nodes and show that NetGO\ncorrelates with alignment quality much better than any existing GO-based\nalignment measures. We also demonstrate that NetGO provides a measure of\ntaxonomic similarity between species, consistent with existing taxonomic\nmeasures--a feature not shared with existing GO-based network alignment\nmeasures.

Specifically, the $q\\bar q$ quark model has difficulties in\nunderstanding the light scalar mesons below 1 GeV, scalar and axial-vector\ncharmed mesons and $1^+$ charmonium-like state $X(3872)$. A common wisdom for\nthe resolution of these difficulties lies on the coupled channel effects which\nwill distort the quark model calculations. In this work, we focus on the near\nmass degeneracy of scalar charmed mesons, $D_{s0}^*$ and $D_0^{*0}$, and its\nimplications. Within the framework of heavy meson chiral perturbation theory,\nwe show that near degeneracy can be qualitatively understood as a consequence\nof self-energy effects due to strong coupled channels. Quantitatively, the\ncloseness of $D_{s0}^*$ and $D_0^{*0}$ masses can be implemented by adjusting\ntwo relevant strong couplings and the renormalization scale appearing in the\nloop diagram. Then this in turn implies the mass similarity of $B_{s0}^*$ and\n$B_0^{*0}$ mesons. The $P_0^* P'_1$ interaction with the Goldstone boson is\ncrucial for understanding the phenomenon of near degeneracy. Based on heavy\nquark symmetry in conjunction with corrections from QCD and $1/m_Q$ effects, we\nobtain the masses of $B^*_{(s)0}$ and $B'_{(s)1}$ mesons, for example,\n$M_{B_{s0}^*}= (5715\\pm1)\\,{\\rm MeV}+\\delta\\Delta_S$,\n$M_{B'_{s1}}=(5763\\pm1)\\,{\\rm MeV}+\\delta\\Delta_S$ with $\\delta\\Delta_S$ being\n$1/m_Q$ corrections.

To prove the result we introduce a\nnew category of modules (called Drinfeld category) related to the Drinfeld\ngenerators of the Yangian Y(gl_n) and define a functor from the category of\nnon-critical Gelfand-Tsetlin modules to the Drinfeld category.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2017 22:45:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Jun 2017 07:43:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-27"}

In contrast to\ntraditional signal processing, the irregularity of the signal domain makes\nselecting a sampling set non-trivial and hard to analyze. Indeed, though\nconditions for graph signal interpolation from noiseless samples exist, they do\nnot lead to a unique sampling set. The presence of noise makes choosing among\nthese sampling sets a hard combinatorial problem. Although greedy sampling\nschemes are commonly used in practice, they have no performance guarantee. This\nwork takes a twofold approach to address this issue. First, universal\nperformance bounds are derived for the Bayesian estimation of graph signals\nfrom noisy samples. In contrast to currently available bounds, they are not\nrestricted to specific sampling schemes and hold for any sampling sets. Second,\nthis paper provides near-optimal guarantees for greedy sampling by introducing\nthe concept of approximate submodularity and updating the classical greedy\nbound. It then provides explicit bounds on the approximate supermodularity of\nthe interpolation mean-square error showing that it can be optimized with\nworst-case guarantees using greedy search even though it is not supermodular.\nSimulations illustrate the derived bound for different graph models and show an\napplication of graph signal sampling to reduce the complexity of kernel\nprincipal component analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2017 00:09:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Sep 2017 19:48:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

Its intuitive idea is that the\nstatistical ensemble can be divided into two disjoint parts so that the\ncorrelation disappears in both of the resulting subensembles if there is no\ncausal connection between these correlated events. These subensembles can be\nregarded as common causes. Hofer-Szab\\'{o} and R\\'{e}dei (2004) generalized a\nReichenbachian common cause, and called it a Reichenbachian common cause\nsystem. In the case of Reichenbachian common cause systems the statistical\nensemble is divided more than two, while it is divided into two parts in the\ncase of Reichenbachian common causes. The number of these subensembles is\ncalled the size of this system. In the present paper, we examine Reichenbachian\ncommon cause systems in general probability theories which include classical\nprobability theories and quantum probability theories. It is shown that there\nis no Reichenbachian common cause system for any correlation between two events\nwhich are not logical independent, and that a general probability theory which\nis represented by an atomless orthomodular lattice with a faithful\n$\\sigma$-additive probability measure contains Reichenbachian common cause\nsystems of size 3 for any correlation between two compatible and logical\nindependent events. Moreover, we discuss a relation between Bell's inequality\nand Reichenbachian common cause systems, and point out that this violation of\nBell's inequality can be compatible with a Reichenbachian common cause system\nalthough it contradicts a `common' common cause system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2017 00:41:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2017 08:46:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-19"}

The NODDI\nmodel has been a popular approach to the estimation of tissue microstructure in\nmany neuroscience studies. It represents the diffusion signals with three types\nof diffusion in tissue: intra-cellular, extra-cellular, and cerebrospinal fluid\ncompartments. However, the original NODDI method uses a computationally\nexpensive procedure to fit the model and could require a large number of\ndiffusion gradients for accurate microstructure estimation, which may be\nimpractical for clinical use. Therefore, efforts have been devoted to efficient\nand accurate NODDI microstructure estimation with a reduced number of diffusion\ngradients. In this work, we propose a deep network based approach to the NODDI\nmicrostructure estimation, which is named Microstructure Estimation using a\nDeep Network (MEDN). Motivated by the AMICO algorithm which accelerates the\ncomputation of NODDI parameters, we formulate the microstructure estimation\nproblem in a dictionary-based framework. The proposed network comprises two\ncascaded stages. The first stage resembles the solution to a dictionary-based\nsparse reconstruction problem and the second stage computes the final\nmicrostructure using the output of the first stage. The weights in the two\nstages are jointly learned from training data, which is obtained from training\ndMRI scans with diffusion gradients that densely sample the q-space. The\nproposed method was applied to brain dMRI scans, where two shells each with 30\ngradient directions (60 diffusion gradients in total) were used. Estimation\naccuracy with respect to the gold standard was measured and the results\ndemonstrate that MEDN outperforms the competing algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2017 02:37:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-06"}

In addition, photo capturing process has become trivial due to the\nadvances in mobile imaging. Hence people capture a lot of photos everyday and\nthey want them to be visually-attractive. This has given rise to automated,\none-touch enhancement tools. However, the inability of those tools to provide\npersonalized and content-adaptive enhancement has paved way for machine-learned\nmethods to do the same. The existing typical machine-learned methods\nheuristically (e.g. kNN-search) predict the enhancement parameters for a new\nimage by relating the image to a set of similar training images. These\nheuristic methods need constant interaction with the training images which\nmakes the parameter prediction sub-optimal and computationally expensive at\ntest time which is undesired. This paper presents a novel approach to\npredicting the enhancement parameters given a new image using only its\nfeatures, without using any training images. We propose to model the\ninteraction between the image features and its corresponding enhancement\nparameters using the matrix factorization (MF) principles.

Using this insight, we propose a novel walking pattern generator\nthat optimally selects step location and timing at every control cycle. Our\napproach is computationally simple compared to standard approaches in the\nliterature, yet guarantees that any viable state will remain viable in the\nfuture. We propose a swing foot adaptation strategy and integrate the pattern\ngenerator with an inverse dynamics controller that does not explicitly control\nthe center of mass nor the foot center of pressure.

Though successful, the\ntraining convergence of this triplet model can be compromised by the fact that\nthe vast majority of the training samples will produce gradients with\nmagnitudes that are close to zero. This issue has motivated the development of\nmethods that explore the global structure of the embedding and other methods\nthat explore hard negative/positive mining. The effectiveness of such mining\nmethods is often associated with intractable computational requirements. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel deep metric learning method that combines the\ntriplet model and the global structure of the embedding space. We rely on a\nsmart mining procedure that produces effective training samples for a low\ncomputational cost. In addition, we propose an adaptive controller that\nautomatically adjusts the smart mining hyper-parameters and speeds up the\nconvergence of the training process. We show empirically that our proposed\nmethod allows for fast and more accurate training of triplet ConvNets than\nother competing mining methods.

By leveraging stochastic geom- etry and queuing\ntheory, we derive closed-form expressions for the UL and DL packet throughput,\nalso capturing the impact of random traffic arrivals and packet\nretransmissions. Through our analysis, which is validated via simulations, we\nconfirm that D-TDD outperforms S-TDD in DL, with the vice versa occurring in\nUL, since asymmetric transmissions reduce DL interference at the expense of an\nincreased UL interference. We also find that in asymmetric scenarios, where\nmost of the traffic is in DL, D-TDD provides a DL packet throughput gain by\nbetter controlling the queuing delay, and that such gain vanishes in the\nlight-traffic regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2017 08:21:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-06"}

The successful experimental demonstration of QSDC opens up the\npossibilities for practical implementation of QD protocols. Thus, it is\nnecessary to analyze the practical security issues of QD protocols for future\nimplementation. Since the very first proposal for QD by Nguyen (Phys. Lett. A,\n2004) a large number of variants and extensions have been presented till date.\nHowever, all of those leak half of the secret bits to the adversary through\nclassical communications of the measurement results. In this direction,\nmotivated by the idea of Lo et al. (Phys. Rev.

In the\nproposed protocol, Alice and Bob, two legitimate parties, are allowed to\nprepare the states only. The states are measured by an untrusted third party\n(UTP) who may himself behave as an adversary. We show that our protocol is\nsecure under this adversarial model. The current protocol does not require any\nquantum memory and thus it is inherently robust against memory attacks. Such\nrobustness might not be guaranteed in the QSDC protocol with quantum memory\n(Phys. Rev.

Unlike the conventional model cascade (MC) that\nis composed of multiple independent models, LC treats a single deep model as a\ncascade of several sub-models. Earlier sub-models are trained to handle easy\nand confident regions, and they progressively feed-forward harder regions to\nthe next sub-model for processing. Convolutions are only calculated on these\nregions to reduce computations. The proposed method possesses several\nadvantages. First, LC classifies most of the easy regions in the shallow stage\nand makes deeper stage focuses on a few hard regions. Such an adaptive and\n'difficulty-aware' learning improves segmentation performance. Second, LC\naccelerates both training and testing of deep network thanks to early decisions\nin the shallow stage.

The results apply\nto random walks both with drift (the mean of random walk increments) and with\nno drift under mild moments assumptions on the increments.\n  Assuming increments of the random walk have finite second moment and non-zero\nmean, Snyder and Steele showed that $n^{-1} L_n$ converges almost surely to a\ndeterministic limit, and proved an upper bound on the variance Var$[ L_n] =\nO(n)$.

The precise mechanisms of\njudgment propagation are not well understood, however, because it is difficult\nto control for confounding factors such as homophily or dynamic network\nstructures. We introduce a novel experimental design that renders possible the\nstringent study of judgment propagation. In this design, experimental chains of\nindividuals can revise their initial judgment in a visual perception task after\nobserving a predecessor's judgment. The positioning of a very good performer at\nthe top of a chain created a performance gap, which triggered waves of judgment\npropagation down the chain. We evaluated the dynamics of judgment propagation\nexperimentally. Despite strong social influence within pairs of individuals,\nthe reach of judgment propagation across a chain rarely exceeded a social\ndistance of three to four degrees of separation. Furthermore, computer\nsimulations showed that the speed of judgment propagation decayed exponentially\nwith the social distance from the source. We show that information distortion\nand the overweighting of other people's errors are two individual-level\nmechanisms hindering judgment propagation at the scale of the chain. Our\nresults contribute to the understanding of social contagion processes, and our\nexperimental method offers numerous new opportunities to study judgment\npropagation in the laboratory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2017 12:33:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-06"}

In this work, we define a concept\nof information diet -- which is the topical distribution of a given set of\ninformation items (e.g., tweets) -- to characterize the information produced\nand consumed by various types of users in the popular Twitter social media. At\na high level, we find that (i) popular users mostly produce very specialized\ndiets focusing on only a few topics; in fact, news organizations (e.g.,\nNYTimes) produce much more focused diets on social media as compared to their\nmass media diets, (ii) most users' consumption diets are primarily focused\ntowards one or two topics of their interest, and (iii) the personalized\nrecommendations provided by Twitter help to mitigate some of the topical\nimbalances in the users' consumption diets, by adding information on diverse\ntopics apart from the users' primary topics of interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2017 14:15:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-19"}

By constantly changing a system, Moving Target Defense (MTD)\nhas provided a promising way to reduce or move the attack surface that is\navailable for exploitation by an adversary. However, the current network- based\nMTD obfuscates networks indiscriminately that makes some networks key services,\nsuch as web and DNS services, unavailable, because many information of these\nservices has to be opened to the outside and remain real without compromising\ntheir usability. Moreover, the indiscriminate obfuscation also severely reduces\nthe performance of networks. In this paper, we propose CHAOS, an SDN\n(Software-defined networking)-based MTD system, which discriminately obfuscates\nhosts with different security levels in a network. In CHAOS, we introduce a\nChaos Tower Obfuscation (CTO) method, which uses a Chaos Tower Structure (CTS)\nto depict the hierarchy of all the hosts in an intranet and provides a more\nunpredictable and flexible obfuscation method. We also present the design of\nCHAOS, which leverages SDN features to obfuscate the attack surface including\nIP obfuscation, ports obfuscation, and fingerprint obfuscation thereby\nenhancing the unpredictability of the networking environment. We develop fast\nCTO algorithms to achieve a different degree of obfuscation for the hosts in\neach layer. Our experimental results show that a network protected by CHAOS is\ncapable of decreasing the percentage of information disclosure effectively to\nguarantee the normal flow of traffic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2017 15:25:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-06"}

The Leggett-Garg (LG) inequalities, the most\ncommonly-studied test, are only necessary conditions for macrorealism, but\nbuilding on earlier work it is shown that when the four three-time LG\ninequalities are augmented with a certain set of two-time inequalities also of\nthe LG form, Fine's theorem applies and these augmented conditions are then\nboth necessary and sufficient. A comparison is carried out with a very\ndifferent set of necessary and sufficient conditions for macrorealism, namely\nthe no-signaling in time (NSIT) conditions proposed by Brukner, Clemente,\nKofler and others, which ensure that all probabilities for Q at one and two\ntimes are independent of whether earlier or intermediate measurements are made\nin a given run, and do not require (but imply) the LG inequalities. We argue\nthat tests based on the LG inequalities have the form of very weak classicality\nconditions and can be satisfied in the face of moderate interference effects,\nbut those based on NSIT conditions have the form of much stronger coherence\nwitness conditions, satisfied only for zero interference. The two tests differ\nin their implementation of non-invasive measurability so are testing different\nnotions of macrorealism: the augmented LG tests are indirect, entailing a\ncombination of the results of different experiments with only compatible\nquantities measured in each experimental run, in close analogy with Bell tests,\nand are primarily tests for macrorealism per se; by contrast the NSIT tests\nentail sequential measurements of incompatible quantities and are primarily\ntests for non-invasiveness\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2017 15:26:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 23 Apr 2017 15:39:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 27 Jun 2017 13:00:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-26"}

This includes the calculation of the critical magnetic fields for the\ntransition to an array of magnetic flux tubes, based on an approximation for\nthe interaction between the flux tubes. We find that the transition region\nbetween type-I and type-II superconductivity changes qualitatively due to the\npresence of the superfluid: the phase transitions at the upper and lower\ncritical fields in the type-II regime become first order, opening the\npossibility of clustered flux tube phases.

The strong magnetic fields and fast rotation of these magnetars\nmake them promising sources for gravitational wave (GW) detection using ground\nbased GW interferometers. Based on the observed masses of Galactic NS-NS\nbinaries, by assuming different equations of state (EOSs) of dense matter, we\ninvestigate the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) produced by an\nensemble of newly born massive magnetars. The massive magnetar formation rate\nis estimated through: (i) the SGRB formation rate (hereafter entitled as MFR1);\n(ii) the NS-NS merger rate (hereafter entitled as MFR2). We find that for\nmassive magnetars with masses $M_{\\rm mg}=2.4743 M_\\odot$, if EOS CDDM2 is\nassumed, the resultant SGWBs may be detected by the future Einstein Telescope\n(ET) even for MFR1 with minimal local formation rate, and for MFR2 with a local\nmerger rate $\\dot{\\rho}_{\\rm c}^{\\rm o}(0)\\lesssim 10$ ${\\rm Mpc}^{-3}{\\rm\nMyr}^{-1}$. However, if EOS BSk21 is assumed, the SGWB may be detectable by the\nET for MFR1 with the maximal local formation rate. Moreover, the background\nspectra show cutoffs at about 350 Hz in the case of EOS BSk21, and at 124 Hz\nfor CDDM2, respectively. We suggest that if the cutoff at $\\sim100$ Hz in the\nbackground spectrum from massive magnetars could be detected, then the quark\nstar EOS CDDM2 seems to be favorable. Moreover, the EOSs, which present\nrelatively small TOV maximum masses, would be excluded.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2017 04:19:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-26"}

We investigate the evolutions of accreting NSs in IMXBs (similar to M82\nX-2) with a $\\sim5.2M_\\odot$ companion, and orbit period $\\simeq2.53$ day. By\nadopting an mildly super-Eddington rate $\\dot{M}=6\\times10^{-8}M_\\odot~{\\rm\nyr}^{-1}$ for the early Case B Roche-lobe overflow (RLOF) accretion, we find\nonly in accreting NSs with quite elastic crusts (slippage factor $s=0.05$), the\ntoroidal magnetic fields can be amplified within 1 Myrs, which is assumed to be\nthe longest duration of the RLOF. These IMXBs will evolve into NS+white dwarf\n(WD) binaries if they are dynamical stable. However, before the formation of\nNS+WD binaries, the high stellar density in the GC will probably lead to\nfrequent encounters between the NS+evolved star binaries (in post-early Case B\nmass transfer phase) and NSs or exchange encounters with other stars, which may\nproduce single NSs. These NSs will evolve into magnetars when the amplified\npoloidal magnetic fields diffuse out to the NS surfaces. Consequently, our\nresults provide a possible explanation for the origin of the GC magnetar SGR\n1745-2900. Moreover, the accreting NSs with $s>0.05$ will evolve into\nmillisecond pulsars (MSPs). Therefore, our model reveals the GC magnetars and\nMSPs could both originate from the special kind of IMXBs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2017 05:18:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-14"}

Different IAW\nmodes excited by stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) and different SBS\nbehaviors in several typical ignition hohlraum plasmas in the high-temperature\nand high-density region have been researched by Vlasov-Maxwell simulation. The\nslow mode in HeH or CH plasmas is the least damped mode and will be excited in\nSBS, while the fast mode in AuB plasmas is the least damped mode and will be\nexcited in SBS. Due to strong Landau damping, the SBS in H or HeH plasmas is\nstrong convective instability, while the SBS in AuB plasmas is absolute\ninstability due to the weak Landau damping. However, although the SBS in CH\nplasmas is weak convective instability in the linear theory, the SBS will\ntransform into absolute instability due to decreasing linear Landau damping by\nparticles trapping. These results give a detail research of the IAW modes\nexcitation and the properties of SBS in different species plasmas, thus\nproviding the possibility of controlling SBS by increasing the linear Landau\ndamping of the IAW by changing ion species.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2017 08:36:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-11"}

Welton et al. proposed models for the analysis of\nmeta-epidemiological data, but these models are restrictive because they force\nheterogeneity among studies with a particular characteristic to be at least as\nlarge as that among studies without the characteristic. In this paper we\npresent alternative models that are invariant to the labels defining the two\ncategories of studies. To exemplify the methods, we use a collection of\nmeta-analyses in which the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool has been implemented. We\nfirst investigate the influence of small trial sample sizes (less than 100\nparticipants), before investigating the influence of multiple methodological\nflaws (inadequate or unclear sequence generation, allocation concealment and\nblinding). We fit both the Welton et al. model and our proposed label-invariant\nmodel and compare the results. Estimates of mean bias associated with the trial\ncharacteristics and of between-trial variances are not very sensitive to the\nchoice of model. Results from fitting a univariable model show that\nheterogeneity variance is, on average, 88% greater among trials with less than\n100 participants. Based on a multivariable model, heterogeneity variance is, on\naverage, 25% greater among trials with inadequate/unclear sequence generation,\n51% greater among trials with inadequate/unclear blinding, and 23% lower among\ntrials with inadequate/unclear allocation concealment, though the 95% intervals\nfor these ratios are very wide.
