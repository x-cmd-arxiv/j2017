A simple theoretical model of the flowmeter is\nconsidered where the flow is approximated by a solid finite-thickness\nconducting layer which moves in the presence of an ac magnetic field. In\ncontrast to the original design [Priede et al., Meas. Sci. Technol. 22 (2011)\n055402], where the flow rate is determined by measuring only the phase shift\nbetween the voltages induced in two receiving coils, the improved design\nmeasures also the phase shift between the sending and the upstream receiving\ncoils. These two phase shifts are referred to as internal and external ones,\nrespectively. We show that the effect of electrical conductivity on the\ninternal phase shift, which is induced by the flow, can be strongly reduced by\nrescaling it with the external phase shift, which depends mostly on the\nconductivity of medium. Two different rescalings are found depending on the ac\nfrequency. At low frequencies, when the shielding effect is weak, the effect of\nconductivity is strongly reduced by rescaling the internal phase shift with the\nexternal one squared. At higher frequencies, the same is achieved by rescaling\nthe internal phase shift directly with the external one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Apr 2017 17:02:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Sep 2017 15:31:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2018 12:26:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-03"}

We propose a novel solution to\nthese problems: incremental interventions that shift propensity score values\nrather than set treatments to fixed values. Incremental interventions have\nseveral crucial advantages.

We use the the\nmaxmin share paradigm introduced by Budish as a measure for fairness. Procaccia\nand Wang (EC'14) were first to investigate this fundamental problem in the\nadditive setting. In contrast to what real-world experiments suggest, they show\nthat a maxmin guarantee (1-MMS allocation) is not always possible even when the\nnumber of agents is limited to 3. While the existence of an approximation\nsolution (e.g. a $1/2$-MMS allocation) is quite straightforward, improving the\nguarantee becomes subtler for larger constants. Procaccia provide a proof for\nexistence of a $2/3$-MMS allocation and leave the question open for better\nguarantees.\n  Our main contribution is an answer to the above question. We improve the\nresult of [Procaccia and Wang] to a $3/4$ factor in the additive setting. The\nmain idea for our $3/4$-MMS allocation method is clustering the agents. To this\nend, we introduce three notions and techniques, namely reducibility, matching\nallocation, and cycle-envy-freeness, and prove the approximation guarantee of\nour algorithm via non-trivial applications of these techniques.

The task becomes very difficult due to the presence of\nvarious motion artifacts. The objective is to develop algorithms to reduce the\neffect of motion artifacts and thus obtain accurate heart rate estimation.\nMethods- Proposed heart rate estimation scheme utilizes both time and frequency\ndomain analyses. Unlike conventional single stage adaptive filter, multi-stage\ncascaded adaptive filtering is introduced by using three channel accelerometer\ndata to reduce the effect of motion artifacts. Both recursive least squares\n(RLS) and least mean squares (LMS) adaptive filters are tested. Moreover,\nsingular spectrum analysis (SSA) is employed to obtain improved spectral peak\ntracking. The outputs from the filter block and SSA operation are logically\ncombined and used for spectral domain heart rate estimation.

Typically, the particles are permanently\nfixed within the matrix, which makes them distinguishable by their positions.\nOver time, particle neighbors do not change due to the fixation by the matrix.\nHere we present a classical density functional approach for such ferrogels.

However, the performance of these\ndeep CNN methods is often compromised by the constraint that the neural network\nonly takes the fixed-size input. To accommodate this requirement, input images\nneed to be transformed via cropping, warping, or padding, which often alter\nimage composition, reduce image resolution, or cause image distortion. Thus the\naesthetics of the original images is impaired because of potential loss of fine\ngrained details and holistic image layout. However, such fine grained details\nand holistic image layout is critical for evaluating an image's aesthetics. In\nthis paper, we present an Adaptive Layout-Aware Multi-Patch Convolutional\nNeural Network (A-Lamp CNN) architecture for photo aesthetic assessment. This\nnovel scheme is able to accept arbitrary sized images, and learn from both\nfined grained details and holistic image layout simultaneously. To enable\ntraining on these hybrid inputs, we extend the method by developing a dedicated\ndouble-subnet neural network structure, i.e. a Multi-Patch subnet and a\nLayout-Aware subnet. We further construct an aggregation layer to effectively\ncombine the hybrid features from these two subnets.

Precision measurements by PAMELA and\nAMS-02 of the positron spectrum and its striking difference from the electron\nspectrum have prompted several theoretical speculations. In order to\ndiscriminate among different interpretations of the 'positron anomaly', a major\nstep is needed to achieve an accurate direct measurement of the shape of the\ninclusive electron spectrum beyond 1 TeV. Ongoing efforts along this direction\nby instruments already in orbit and by the recently launched CALET and DAMPE\nmissions are described. A challenging experimental scenario, at variance with\nthe standard paradigm of a single power law spectrum, emerges for the\ncosmic-ray charged hadrons after the discovery of a discrepant hardening in the\nrigidity spectra of protons and He in the 200 to 300 GV region (CREAM, PAMELA,\nAMS-02) and the observation by AMS-02 of a possible break in the Li spectrum.\nAn additional puzzle comes from the apparent violation of the universality of\nspectral indices whereby He and proton spectra are progressively hardening\nabove ~100 GV with a similar rigidity dependence, but the He spectrum is harder\nthan proton's. Secondary-to-primary ratios and isotope flux ratios provide\ninsight into the subtleties of propagation mechanism(s) and test the internal\nconsistency of the models of acceleration and propagation of cosmic rays in the\ngalaxy. Important complementary information on the abundance of nuclei heavier\nthan iron comes from dedicated balloon-borne instruments as SuperTIGER or\nspace-based missions as ACE at L1 that provided the first measurement of a\nprimary \"cosmic-ray clock\".

Achieving these goals requires sharing orbital debris and other SSA\ndata. Toward this, I present an ontological architecture for the orbital debris\ndomain, taking steps in the creation of an orbital debris ontology (ODO). The\npurpose of this ontological system is to (I) represent general orbital debris\nand SSA domain knowledge, (II) structure, and standardize where needed, orbital\ndata and terminology, and (III) foster semantic interoperability and\ndata-sharing. In doing so I hope to (IV) contribute to solving the orbital\ndebris problem, improving peaceful global SSA, and ensuring safe space travel\nfor future generations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Apr 2017 21:26:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Dec 2017 06:25:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2021 21:14:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

J. C. Maxwell was the first to employ the\nquaternions to study the physical properties of electromagnetic fields. His\nmethod inspires some subsequent scholars to introduce the quaternions,\noctonions, and sedenions to research the electromagnetic field, gravitational\nfield, nuclear field, quantum mechanics, and gauge field. The application of\ncomplex-sedenions is capable of depicting not only the field equations of the\nclassical mechanics on the macroscopic scale, but also the field equations of\nthe quantum mechanics on the microscopic scale. The latter can be degenerated\ninto the Dirac equation and Yang-Mills equation. In contrast to the\ncomplex-number wavefunction, the wavefunction in the complex-quaternion space\npossesses three new degrees of freedom, that is, three color degrees of\nfreedom. One complex-quaternion wavefunction is equivalent to three\nconventional wavefunctions with the complex-numbers. It means that the three\nspatial dimensions of unit vector in the complex-quaternion wavefunction can be\nconsidered as the `three colors', naturally the color confinement will be\neffective. In other words, in the complex-quaternion space, the `three colors'\nare only the spatial dimensions, rather than any property of physical\nsubstance. The existing `three colors' can be merged into the wavefunction,\ndescribed with the complex-quaternions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Apr 2017 14:34:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-22"}
