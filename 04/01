Computational prediction of protein\nmutation impacts offers a fast, economical and potentially accurate alternative\nto laboratory mutagenesis.

Results: Topology based mutation\npredictor (T-MP) is introduced to dramatically reduce the geometric complexity\nand number of degrees of freedom of proteins, while element specific persistent\nhomology is proposed to retain essential biological information.

For\nexample, MoTe$_2$ crystallizes in the 2H semiconducting phase at ambient\ntemperature and pressure, but transitions into the 1T$^\\prime$ semimetallic\nphase at high temperatures. Alloying MoTe$_2$ with WTe$_2$ reduces the energy\nbarrier between these two phases, while also allowing access to the T$_d$ Weyl\nsemimetal phase. The MoWTe$_2$ alloy system is therefore promising for\ndeveloping phase change memory technology. However, achieving this goal\nnecessitates a detailed understanding of the phase composition in the\nMoTe$_2$-WTe$_2$ system. We combine polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy\nwith X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning transmission electron microscopy\n(STEM) to study MoWTe$_2$ alloys over the full compositional range x from 0 to\n1. We identify Raman and XRD signatures characteristic of the 2H, 1T$^\\prime$,\nand T$_d$ structural phases that agree with density-functional theory (DFT)\ncalculations, and use them to identify phase fields in the MoTe$_2$-WTe$_2$\nsystem, including single-phase 2H, 1T$^\\prime$, and T$_d$ regions, as well as a\ntwo-phase 1T$^\\prime$ + T$_d$ region. Disorder arising from compositional\nfluctuations in MoWTe$_2$ alloys breaks inversion and translational symmetry,\nleading to the activation of an infrared 1T$^\\prime$-MoTe$_2$ mode and the\nenhancement of a double-resonance Raman process in 2H-MoWTe$_2$ alloys.\nCompositional fluctuations limit the phonon correlation length, which we\nestimate by fitting the observed asymmetric Raman lineshapes with a phonon\nconfinement model. These observations reveal the important role of disorder in\nMoWTe$_2$ alloys, clarify the structural phase boundaries, and provide a\nfoundation for future explorations of phase transitions and electronic\nphenomena in this system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2017 17:03:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-12"}

We find that sizes many\norders of magnitude larger than the resonant wavelength are typically required.\nUsing one-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we show that the failure to\nsufficiently resolve the spectral support of the longitudinal instability\nyields slower growth and lower levels of saturation, potentially leading to\nerroneous physical conclusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2017 18:00:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Oct 2017 23:32:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-20"}

We investigate this via a comparison of\nmagnetar birth rates, the FRB volumetric rate, and host galaxy demographics. We\ncalculate average volumetric rates of possible millisecond magnetar production\nchannels such as superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), long and short gamma-ray\nbursts (GRBs), and general magnetar production via core-collapse supernovae.\nFor each channel we also explore the expected host galaxy demographics using\ntheir known properties.

By comparing rates we find that production via rare channels (SLSNe, GRBs)\nimplies a typical FRB lifetime of $\\approx$30-300 yr, in good agreement with\nother lines of argument. The total energy emitted over this time is consistent\nwith the available energy stored in the magnetic field. On the other hand, any\nrelation to magnetars produced via normal core-collapse supernovae leads to a\nvery short lifetime of $\\approx$0.5yr, in conflict with both theory and\nobservation.

These changes, referred to as\nconcept drift, can cause the predictive performance of the classifier to drop\nover time, thereby making it obsolete. To be of any real use, these classifiers\nneed to detect drifts and be able to adapt to them, over time. Detecting drifts\nhas traditionally been approached as a supervised task, with labeled data\nconstantly being used for validating the learned model. Although effective in\ndetecting drifts, these techniques are impractical, as labeling is a difficult,\ncostly and time consuming activity. On the other hand, unsupervised change\ndetection techniques are unreliable, as they produce a large number of false\nalarms. The inefficacy of the unsupervised techniques stems from the exclusion\nof the characteristics of the learned classifier, from the detection process.\nIn this paper, we propose the Margin Density Drift Detection (MD3) algorithm,\nwhich tracks the number of samples in the uncertainty region of a classifier,\nas a metric to detect drift. The MD3 algorithm is a distribution independent,\napplication independent, model independent, unsupervised and incremental\nalgorithm for reliably detecting drifts from data streams. Experimental\nevaluation on 6 drift induced datasets and 4 additional datasets from the\ncybersecurity domain demonstrates that the MD3 approach can reliably detect\ndrifts, with significantly fewer false alarms compared to unsupervised feature\nbased drift detectors. The reduced false alarms enables the signaling of drifts\nonly when they are most likely to affect classification performance. As such,\nthe MD3 approach leads to a detection scheme which is credible, label efficient\nand general in its applicability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2017 18:55:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-04"}

The locking of the second pump, through adiabatic tuning of\nits frequency, to the comb generated by the first pump allows transitioning to\nsingle-soliton states, manipulating the position of Kerr solitons in the\ncavity, and tuning the frequency comb repetition rate within the locking range.\nIt also explains soliton crystal formation in resonators supporting a\ndispersive wave emitted as a result of higher-order group velocity dispersion\nor avoided mode crossing.

However, designing and\nimplementing DSLs is not an easy task, as it requires knowledge of the\napplication domain and experience in language engineering and compilers.\nConsequently, many DSLs follow a weak approach using macros or text generators,\nwhich lack many of the features that make a DSL a comfortable for programmers.\nSome of these features---e.g., syntax highlighting, type inference, error\nreporting, and code completion---are easily provided by language workbenches,\nwhich combine language engineering techniques and tools in a common ecosystem.\nIn this paper, we present the Parallel Particle-Mesh Environment (PPME), a DSL\nand development environment for numerical simulations based on particle methods\nand hybrid particle-mesh methods. PPME uses the meta programming system (MPS),\na projectional language workbench. PPME is the successor of the Parallel\nParticle-Mesh Language (PPML), a Fortran-based DSL that used conventional\nimplementation strategies. We analyze and compare both languages and\ndemonstrate how the programmer's experience can be improved using static\nanalyses and projectional editing. Furthermore, we present an explicit domain\nmodel for particle abstractions and the first formal type system for particle\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2017 19:39:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 Sep 2017 13:50:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-19"}

The re-training process effectively performs distance\nmetric learning under the object persistency constraints, to modify the\nview-manifold of object representations. It reduces the effective distance\nbetween the representations of different views of the same object without\ncompromising the distance between those of the views of different objects,\nresulting in the untangling of the view-manifolds between individual objects\nwithin the same category and across categories. This untangling enables the\nmodel to discriminate and recognize objects within the same category,\nindependent of viewpoints. We found that this ability is not limited to the\ntrained objects, but transfers to novel objects in both trained and untrained\ncategories, as well as to a variety of completely novel artificial synthetic\nobjects. This transfer in learning suggests the modification of distance\nmetrics in view- manifolds is more general and abstract, likely at the levels\nof parts, and independent of the specific objects or categories experienced\nduring training. Interestingly, the resulting transformation of feature\nrepresentation in the deep networks is found to significantly better match\nhuman perceptual similarity judgment than AlexNet, suggesting that object\npersistence could be an important constraint in the development of perceptual\nsimilarity judgment in biological neural networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2017 19:50:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-04"}

Among technologies to provide the efficiency is full-duplex\nwireless communication. Full-duplex wireless enhances capacity by\nsimultaneously transmitting uplink and downlink data with limited frequency\nresources. Previous studies on full-duplex wireless mostly focuses on doubling\nthe network capacity, whereas in this paper we discuss that full-duplex\nwireless can also provide higher energy efficiency. We propose low power\ncommunication by wireless full-duplexing (LPFD), focusing on the fact that the\nfull-duplex communication duration becomes half of the halfduplex communication\nduration. In the LPFD, by using the sleep state in which the transceiver\nprovided in the wireless communication terminal is turned off, power\nconsumption of the wireless communication terminal is reduced and energy\nefficiency in wireless full duplex is improved. Simulation results show that\nthe energy efficiency achieved by LPFD is up to approximately 17.3 times higher\nthan the energy efficiency achieved by existing full-duplex medium access\nprotocol. Further, it is up to approximately 27.5 times higher than the energy\nefficiency using power saving mode of half-duplex communication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2017 21:05:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-29"}

Tutorials\nare supposed to help here. While in the early days of computing, mostly text\ntutorials were available, nowadays software developers can choose among a huge\nnumber of tutorials for almost any popular software tool. However, only little\nresearch was conducted to understand how text tutorials differ from other\ntutorials, which tutorial types are preferred and, especially, which tutorial\ntypes yield the best learning experience in terms of efficiency and\neffectiveness, especially for programmers. To evaluate these questions, we\nconverted an existing video tutorial for a novel software tool into a\ncontent-equivalent text tutorial. We then conducted an experiment in three\ngroups where 42 undergraduate students from a software engineering course were\ncommissioned to operate the software tool after using a tutorial: the first\ngroup was provided only with the video tutorial, the second group only with the\ntext tutorial and the third group with both. In this context, the differences\nin terms of efficiency were almost negligible: We could observe that\nparticipants using only the text tutorial completed the tutorial faster than\nthe participants with the video tutorial. However, the participants using only\nthe video tutorial applied the learned content faster, achieving roughly the\nsame bottom line performance. We also found that if both tutorial types are\noffered, participants prefer video tutorials for learning new content but text\ntutorials for looking up \"missed\" information.

Given a set of noisy measurements, PSSE aims at estimating the\nvector of complex voltages at all buses of the network. This is a challenging\ntask due to the inherent nonlinearity of power flows, for which existing\nmethods lack guaranteed convergence and theoretical analysis. Motivating by\nthese limitations, we propose a novel convexification framework for the PSSE\nusing semidefinite programming (SDP) and second-order cone programming (SOCP)\nrelaxations. We first study a related power flow (PF) problem as the noiseless\ncounterpart, which is cast as a constrained minimization program by adding a\nsuitably designed objective function. We study the performance of the proposed\nframework in the case where the set of measurements includes: (i) nodal voltage\nmagnitudes, and (ii) branch active power flows over a spanning tree of the\nnetwork. It is shown that the SDP and SOCP relaxations both recover the true PF\nsolution as long as the voltage angle difference across each line of the\nnetwork is not too large (e.g., less than 90 degrees for lossless networks). By\ncapitalizing on this result, penalized SDP and SOCP problems are designed to\nsolve the PSSE, where a penalty based on the weighted least absolute value is\nincorporated for fitting noisy measurements with possible bad data. Strong\ntheoretical results are derived to quantify the optimal solution of the\npenalized SDP problem, which is shown to possess a dominant rank-one component\nformed by lifting the true voltage vector. An upper bound on the estimation\nerror is also derived as a function of the noise power, which decreases\nexponentially fast as the number of measurements increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Apr 2017 07:53:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-04"}

Here we formulate weakly supervised detection as a\nMultiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem, where instance classifiers (object\ndetectors) are put into the network as hidden nodes. We propose a novel online\ninstance classifier refinement algorithm to integrate MIL and the instance\nclassifier refinement procedure into a single deep network, and train the\nnetwork end-to-end with only image-level supervision, i.e., without object\nlocation information. More precisely, instance labels inferred from weak\nsupervision are propagated to their spatially overlapped instances to refine\ninstance classifier online. The iterative instance classifier refinement\nprocedure is implemented using multiple streams in deep network, where each\nstream supervises its latter stream. Weakly supervised object detection\nexperiments are carried out on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012\nbenchmarks.

We find that Co vacancies (Vc) in all compounds and the\nTi$_\\text{Sn}$ anti-site exhibit negative formation energies. The smallest\npositive values occur for Co in excess on anti-sites (Co$_Z$ or Co$_\\text{Ti}$)\nand for Ti$_Z$. The most abundant native defects were modeled as dilute alloys,\ntreated with the coherent potential approximation in combination with the\nmultiple-scattering theory Green function approach. The self-consistent\npotentials determined this way were used to calculate the residual resistivity\nvia the Kubo-Greenwood formula and, based on its energy dependence, the Seebeck\ncoefficient of the systems. The latter is shown to depend significantly on the\ntype of defect, leading to variations that are related to subtle, spin-orbit\ncoupling induced, changes in the electronic structure above the half-metallic\ngap. Two of the systems, Vc$_\\text{Co}$ and Co$_Z$, are found to exhibit a\nnegative Seebeck coefficient. This observation, together with their low\nformation energy, offers an explanation for the experimentally observed\nnegative Seebeck coefficient of the Co$_2$Ti$Z$ compounds as being due to\nunintentionally created native defects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Apr 2017 10:22:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Jul 2017 07:40:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-06"}

In such a\nscenario, the compositions of the three planets are expected to be similar to\neach other. However, bulk elemental and isotopic data for martian meteorites\ndemonstrate that key aspects of Mars' composition are markedly different from\nthat of Earth. This suggests that Mars formed outside of the terrestrial\nfeeding zone during primary accretion. It is therefore probable that Mars\nalways remained significantly farther from the Sun than Earth; its growth was\nstunted early and its mass remained relatively low.

However, qualitative assessments\nof playmaking (for example making \"smart\" passes) are difficult to quantify. It\nwould be advantageous to have available a single statistic that can emphasize\nthe flow of a game, rewarding those players who initiate and contribute to\nsuccessful plays more. In this paper we will examine a model based on Google's\nPageRank. Other papers have explored ranking teams, coaches, and captains but\nhere we construct ratings and rankings for individual members on both teams\nthat emphasizes initiating and partaking in successful plays and forcing\ndefensive turnovers. For a soccer/hockey/basketball game, our model assigns a\nnode for each of the n players who play in the game and a \"goal node\". Arcs\nbetween player nodes indicate sport-specific situations (including passes,\nturnovers, scoring, fouls, out-of-bounds, play-stoppages, turnovers, missed\nshots, defensive plays etc.), tailored for each sport. As well, some additional\narcs are added in to ensure that the associated matrix is primitive and hence\nthere is a unique PageRank vector. The PageRank vector of the associated matrix\nis used to rank the players of the game. To illustrate the model, data was\ntaken from nine NBA games played between 2014-2016. Many of the top-ranked\nplayers (in the model) in a given game had some of the most impressive\ntraditional stat-lines. However, from the model there were surprises where some\nplayers who had impressive stat-lines had lower ranks, and others who had less\nimpressive stat-lines had higher ranks.

We present a\nsimple algorithm for computing an optimized version of the DMD for data which\nmay be collected at unevenly spaced sample times. By making use of the variable\nprojection method for nonlinear least squares problems, the algorithm is\ncapable of solving the underlying nonlinear optimization problem efficiently.\nWe explore the performance of the algorithm with some numerical examples for\nsynthetic and real data from dynamical systems and find that the resulting\ndecomposition displays less bias in the presence of noise than standard DMD\nalgorithms. Because of the flexibility of the algorithm, we also present some\ninteresting new options for DMD-based analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Apr 2017 15:38:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-11"}

Deploying a number of (video) cameras is a\ncommon surveillance approach. Given the never-ending power offered by vehicles\nto metropolises, exploiting vehicle traffic to design camera placement\nstrategies could potentially facilitate security surveillance. This article\nconstitutes the first effort toward building the linkage between vehicle\ntraffic and security surveillance, which is a critical problem for smart\ncities. We expect our study could influence the decision making of surveillance\ncamera placement, and foster more research of principled ways of security\nsurveillance beneficial to our physical-world life.
